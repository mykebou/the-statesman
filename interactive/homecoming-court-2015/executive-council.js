I was a member of the executive council as the Freshman Class Representative, I've attended countless senate meetings, and have even gotten the opportunity to proxy for multiple senators.  Since I've entered Stony Brook University, I have always approached USG with fresh initiatives.  An example of this would be the Classroom Overflow initiative, which has an entire committee dedicated to resolving this issue.  My plans for both USG and Stony Brook University are long term.  Equally important, my party members also share similar ideals, and we will continue to strive for a better campus whether elected or not!","party":"house","response":"TRUE","photo":null,"won":"TRUE"},
