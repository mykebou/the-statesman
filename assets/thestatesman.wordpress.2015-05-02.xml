		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_33951" align="alignleft" width="648"]<img class="size-full wp-image-33951" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Wrestling-Team-2013.gif" alt="(PHOTO CREDIT: JOHN GRIFFIN / STONYBROOK.EDU)" width="648" height="432" /> The Stony Brook club wrestling team, under the direction of coach Alex Blank, headed to Madison Square Garden last weekend to face the Montclair State Red Hawks at the third annual Grapple at the Garden. This is the team's first season without former Head Coach Shaun Lally, who took on a position at Muhlenberg College in October. (PHOTO CREDIT: JOHN GRIFFIN / WWW.STONYBROOK.EDU)[/caption]

Last Saturday, Stony Brook’s club wrestling team took to the mats at arguably the grandest stage of the year, Madison Square Garden, to take on the Montclair State in a dual-meet at the third annual Grapple at the Garden. Despite a fast start, the Seawolves fell to the Red Hawks by a final score of 39-15.

“It’s nothing like any of us had ever seen before,” SBU wrestling coach Alex Blank said. “Walking into a place like Madison Square Garden, you know, just the arena itself is incredible and noteworthy. It presents a whole new take on the sport. Not to mention, you’re mixed in there with top-tier D1 teams. I feel like our guys were appropriately stressed throughout the whole day, being able to focus on what they needed to do and being able to take in the experience that they had."

Freshman Eric Overton tried to build strong momentum early, winning his 125-pound bout by a score of 5-4 after successful takedowns in the first two periods.

“I give Eric Overton a world of credit," Blank said. "If we were to have a first semester MVP, he would be it on the mat because [Eric] never stops working, both in and out of the classroom. He is always focused on getting better.”

Stony Brook hit a tough stretch from then on, beginning with sophomore club president, Jonathan Crespo, losing his match after a second period reversal and subsequent cradle for a pin by Montclair State to win the 133-pound bout.

Bouts three and four were forfeited by Stony Brook due to a lack of wrestlers at the 141-pound and 149-pound weight classes.

Freshman Darren Sergnese, 157 pounds, was pinned within two minutes of the fifth bout after an early takedown, and three back points were awarded to Montclair State.

Junior Shaun Holliday, 165 pounds, followed with a 4-7 decision loss, with all four points being awarded from escapes. Scott Dunkirk, a 174-pound junior, could not break the streak, as he was pinned after a reversal in the second period.

“It wasn’t that they wrestled poorly or that they were underprepared, it was more in just of terms of that they ran into a tough opponent," Blank said. "They will continue to put in the work in the practice room.”

Stony Brook found bright spots on the day in the forms of junior Preston Garrick, 184 pounds, and freshman Connor Watson, 197 pounds. The two successfully recorded back-to-back pins, both in the first period of their respective bouts, with Garrick’s coming in only 24 seconds.

“It’s very tough. I was a lightweight, so I’m glad I never had to deal with that, but I give those guys more credit,” Blank said in response to a question pertaining to the difficulty of wrestling when the match has already been lost. “Those two guys were very focused on what they wanted from the day and they went out there and took it.”

The Seawolves were not able to end on a high note, as 285-pound Peter Lannon was pinned in the final bout, wrapping up a 39-15 Montclair State victory.

This has been Stony Brook’s first semester in two years without Head Coach Shaun Lally, who left in October for a Muhlenberg College coaching position.

“Losing a guy like Coach Lally, you know, is a blow, just in the sense that he did so much for the program, in terms of building it up, giving it notoriety amongst the wrestling community," Blank said.

Despite losing such an integral and influential member of the staff, Blank remains optimistic and confident about the rest of the season.

“We’re cruising into [the] second semester with a lot more experience, in terms of how to manage ourselves on and off the mat," he said. "At the end of the season, I’m looking to finish out with three or four All-Americans. I think that if everyone does their job and continues to commit to the club, we can achieve that.”]]></content:encoded>

The Stony Brook women's basketball team was able to ring in the new year with wins against both Western Michigan and Norfolk State at Island FCU Arena on Dec. 28 and Dec. 29, respectively. The team is now 6-0 at home. (HEATHER CANNON / THE STATESMAN)[/caption]

The Stony Brook women’s basketball team ended 2014 on a high note, defeating both Western Michigan and Norfolk State at Island Federal Credit Union Arena last week. The Seawolves are now 6-0 at home this season and have a 7-6 overall record entering America East conference play.

The two games were part of the Seawolves Holiday Classic, a two-day tournament hosted by Stony Brook featuring four teams playing two games apiece. SBU finished in first place and was the only team to win both of its matchups.

Stony Brook began the tournament on Sunday with a 59-55 win over Western Michigan. Senior Sabre Proctor was the high scorer in the contest, finishing with 20 points. Sophomore Kori Bayne-Walker also added 17 points for the Seawolves.

SBU trailed by six at halftime, but came alive offensively in the second half, shooting 48.1 percent in the game's final 20 minutes.

A strong defensive effort in the final minutes allowed Stony Brook to secure the victory, as the Seawolves only allowed two points in the final 2:48 of regulation.

Stony Brook came back the following day with a 52-46 win over Norfolk State. Proctor once again led the way for her team, scoring 21 points and pulling down 11 rebounds.

The game went down to the wire, with the Seawolves leading by only three points with just 31 seconds remaining. But, SBU was able to hold off the Spartans thanks to a made free throw by Bayne-Walker with 21 seconds left that stretched the team’s lead to four and a steal by Proctor on the Norfolk State's ensuing possession.

Proctor has now scored in double figures in all of the 11 games she has played this year. She is also just two points away from becoming the 14th player in the program’s history to score 1,000 points as a Seawolf.

She will have a chance to reach that milestone this Saturday when Stony Brook hosts New Hampshire. The game is the Seawolves first matchup against an America East opponent this season. Tip-off is set for noon.]]></content:encoded>

Almost a week removed from the program’s biggest victory in its 54-year history, the Stony Brook men’s basketball team returned home to take on the New Hampshire Wildcats. Using both confidence from their previous win and a fundamentally sound second half, the Seawolves earned their first conference win of the year, 71-61.

“I thought we did a good job overcoming a lot of different things,” Head Coach Steve Pikiell said. “We grinded out a win.”

Six days and a 3,000 mile trip home did not stop the Seawolves from putting forward a great effort, and it certainly did not stop the crowd of 3,224 at Island FCU Arena from acknowledging the team’s recent accomplishment.

With the players being announced, the crowd gave a round of applause, offering them a warm welcome home. Halftime featured highlights from the victory over Washington playing on the big screen. Fans stood and cheered, seemingly thanking the team and letting the Seawolves know how proud they were.

“Great crowd, I thank the community for coming out. I thought they gave us great energy today,” Pikiell said.

Riding high off the milestone victory, the Stony Brook players needed to keep their composure and focus. Sometimes, it is difficult to do so after such an emotional win. However, the players seemed to understand the situation and knew how to handle themselves.

“It’s a blessing and a curse. We now have the confidence that we can beat any team in our league,” junior forward Jameel Warney said when asked about the effects of the win at Washington. “But also it puts a target on our back now that we beat an AP-ranked team.”

Warney’s performance on Saturday afternoon clearly underscores the reality of his comments. Fending off a letdown game after Washington, Warney put up 22 points with 10 rebounds, earning his 12th double-double of the season.

Rayshaun McGrew complemented Warney nicely as he also registered a double-double with 14 points and 12 rebounds. With New Hampshire focusing on stopping Warney, having McGrew’s production was important to Stony Brook’s success.

“He’s been a double-double guy, as much as Jameel has been, he’s been right behind him,” Pikiell said, “a great teammate and comes to work every day. He’s got a great work ethic, real pleased with his development.”

The Seawolves also followed their season-long pattern of dominating the rebound battle yet again, as they went +21 on the glass Saturday.

For New Hampshire, which leads the conference in offensive and defensive points per game, it was sophomore Daniel Dion and freshman Tanner Leissner who did the majority of the scoring. Dion made his mark by hitting five three-pointers and totaling 19 points, while Leissner had six boards in addition to his 13 points.

The Wildcats struggled from the free throw line, hitting only 63.6 percent. Moreover, they failed to score from the field in the last 5:07 of the game. Credit the Stony Brook defense for holding off the top offense and asserting their defensive presence.

On Tuesday night, Stony Brook men’s basketball capped off its non-conference schedule with a 70-61 victory against the Columbia Lions at Levien Gymnasium in Manhattan. It was the Seawolves’ second win against the Lions this season. On Nov. 14, Stony Brook beat Columbia 57-56 in a dramatic last-minute put back by McGrew.

The win improved the Seawolves to 10-6 on the season.

Warney finished the game with 25 points on 12-16 shooting, 13 rebounds (six offensive) and two blocks, completing his Division 1-leading 13th double-double. He also entered the game leading the country with 12.3 rebounds per game.

Juniors McGrew and Carson Puriefoy also scored in the double-digits for the Seawolves with 15 and 13, respectively.

Columbia has been led all season by junior guard Maodo Lo, who entered Tuesday’s contest ranked 56th in the country with 17.8 points per game. However, he was only able to score seven points, making two of nine shots from the field. He scored 19 in the first matchup between the two teams.

Originally, Stony Brook was supposed to play Columbia only once this season as part of a two-year home-and-home series. That changed when Pikiell asked Columbia to play in the inaugural game at Island FCU Arena. In return for the favor, the Seawolves would add a game at Columbia later on in the season.

Stony Brook continues its road trip this Saturday, as the Seawolves will head to Burlington to face the University of Vermont Catamounts, who stand at 5-8 on the year. The Catamounts are currently on a four-game losing streak.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>By Drew Ciampa and Cameron Boon</strong>

The Stony Brook women’s basketball team opened up the New Year on Jan. 3, losing to the New Hampshire Wildcats, 60-52, on the Seawolves' home court. The game also marked the start of conference play in the America East.

In its inaugural season, Island Federal Credit Union Arena was unfamiliar with defeat, as both men’s and women’s basketball were perfect at home prior to Saturday’s loss.

The game was not all bad, as a milestone was reached shortly after tip-off. Cheers rang through the arena when senior forward Sabre Proctor scored her 1,000th point in a Stony Brook uniform. Proctor went to the line early in the first half to shoot two free throws, the second being her 1,000th point. Calm and collected, Proctor hit both shots and cemented herself into program history as the 14th player to score 1,000 points in school history.

“It was great to do it on our home court in front of our fans. It’s a great accomplishment, and I give credit to my coaches, teammates and family,” Proctor said of her scoring milestone.

Stony Brook has seen few shooters better than Proctor, as she reached her 1,000th career point in just three years of playing as a member of the Seawolves.

“I’m proud of her for her career and that she reached this milestone here at Stony Brook,” Head Coach Caroline McCombs said.

The Seawolves also saw Brittany Snow and Jessica Ogunnorin contribute on both ends of the court. Snow scored a game-high 16 points and Ogunnorin grabbed six defensive rebounds, totaling 12.

At the end of the day, it was SBU's shooting percentage that hurt them. With just a .370 field goal percentage, the team struggled to keep up with New Hampshire’s balanced scoring attack.

“We made good plays, but we couldn’t keep it consistent throughout the game and that was our downfall today,” Snow said regarding the team’s performance.

New Hampshire freshman center Carlie Pogue and junior guard Elizabeth Belanger led the way for the Wildcats, scoring 12 points each. New Hampshire took advantage of Stony Brook’s 12 turnovers and managed to score 17 of its 60 points off Seawolves miscues.

“It’s a huge factor. Only 12 turnovers which isn’t that bad overall, but the fact that they scored 17 points off those turnovers, that’s hard to defend,” McCombs said, “We will have to continue to work on taking care of the ball.”

On Wednesday, Stony Brook once again hit the court at Island FCU Arena, this time hosting another America East opponent in Vermont. In the contest, the Seawolves held the Catamounts to just 20.4 percent shooting from the field. As a result, the Seawolves came away with a 60-38 victory.

“It was a great team win. We got a lot of different people involved,” McCombs said after the convincing win.

Kori Bayne-Walker led the offensive attack for the Seawolves, scoring 12 points, while dishing out six assists and hauling in six rebounds.

“The team was shooting well so it was easy to drive and kick out. They were knocking down shots and we were able to move the ball well,” the Rochester, NY native said.

This Vermont squad struggled mightily against Stony Brook's defensive unit, which has held six of its last seven opponents under 60 points.

Along with that, Kylie Butler (11.8 ppg) and Sydney Smith (13.5 ppg), the Catamounts’ two leading scorers, were held to a combined 16 points. Butler could not get a shot to fall, finishing 0-for-7 from the field. Smith would score 11 points in the first 12 minutes to keep Vermont in it, but she would not score from the field the rest of the game, allowing Stony Brook to pull away.

The Seawolves are now 5-1 when they hold their opponents to under 40 percent shooting from the floor.

Bayne-Walker started the day hot, scoring six of the first 12 Stony Brook points. Smith, who led all scorers in the matchup, was able to get inside position on a post up and lay the ball in to cut the lead to 14-11 with 14:17 left in the first half.

After that, it was off to the races for the Seawolves. Stony Brook would go off on a 24-8 run, and a balanced run at that. Bayne-Walker, Brittany Snow and Alyssa Coiro had four points each during the spurt, while Kristie Constantino added five to push the Seawolves lead to 21. The Abington, PA native drove the lane and hit a layup with 21 seconds left in the half.

All of this was done without the Seawolves’ leading scorer Proctor, who played all of 74 seconds after picking up two fouls and having to sit on the bench in favor of Coiro.

Emilie Cloutier hit her only shot of the half to get the lead back under 20, but that would do little as far as momentum and getting Vermont back in the game.

Vermont would duplicate their first half production, putting up 19 points again and shooting a dreadful 5-of-30 from the field in the second half.

The Seawolves would keep the Catamounts at arms-length in the second half. Vermont could only get within 16, which was at the 16:05 mark of the period. Proctor quickly responded with a layup plus the foul, which would turn into three of her six-point output.

Vermont’s 38-point output was the lowest SBU has given up to an opposing team since Nov. 25, 2012, when NJIT was only able to put up 34 points against the Beth O’Boyle defense.

“I think (the defense) is still a work in progress. We’re continuing to work on it every day in practice,” McCombs said.

The Seawolves coaching staff will look to continue to improve this stifling defense into more of a threat and will have some time to do so. The next matchup for McCombs' squad is this Wednesday when the Seawolves take on the UMBC Retrievers in Baltimore. Tipoff is scheduled for 7 p.m. at the Retriever Activities Center Arena.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Stony Brook University owes nearly $4.2 million in state-funded tuition aid that was awarded to ineligible students over three years, according to a <a href="http://osc.state.ny.us/audits/allaudits/093015/13t2.pdf">report </a>released on Friday, Jan. 9 by the Office of the New York State Comptroller.

The audit states that the university incorrectly certified many students as being able to receive financial aid under the state Tuition Assistance Program.

TAP provides grants for full-time undergraduate students who are New York state residents and meet income requirements.

The comptroller’s office reviewed 175 randomly selected TAP awards in a period from 2008 to 2011 and disallowed 21 awards for students who were either not in full-time attendance or were not in good academic standing.

Some TAP recipients did not enroll in at least 12 credits in their program of study or repeated courses for which they had already earned credit, the report states.

In an email to the university community regarding the audit, Provost Dennis Assanis called for a review of what he described as an “outdated” interpretation of State Education Department regulations.

“If students who earn their college degree in four years are disallowed TAP, some because of AP classes they took in high school, something is wrong,” Assanis said in the email. “Should these students be treated as transfer students, as the SED position suggests?”

The audit states the university owes the Higher Education Services Corporation, the state agency that administers TAP aid, the $4.2 million plus interest. Assanis said the university will not ask for reimbursement from the audited students.

“The University will make appropriate restitution in ways that will not harm our students or our academic mission,” he said.

Though the junior point guard had a rough stretch coming into the new year, more recent games show signs of promise in his abilities. (HEATHER KHALIFA / THE STATESMAN)[/caption]

<strong>By David Vertsberger and Andrew Eichenholz</strong>
<p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Point #1: Is Carson Puriefoy's recent slump over?
</strong></em></p>
<p dir="ltr">The past month overall has not been the best stretch for junior Carson Puriefoy. Expected to be Jameel Warney’s right-hand man in carrying the load coming into the season, Puriefoy has harmed more than helped in some recent games.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Coming into Saturday's contest against Maine, the junior point guard had not shot over 50 percent in a single game since <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1506991985"><span class="aQJ">Dec. 13</span></span>. During a four-game stretch from Dec. 28 to Jan. 10, he shot a combined 6-of-42 from the field. That equates to a 14.3 shooting percentage from the team’s former leading scorer. This latest streak of putrid shooting nights is troubling as the team continues on into conference play, but even more concerning is Puriefoy's underwhelming season as a whole.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Puriefoy’s struggles could be a result of his added minutes and usage this season. He is playing a career-high in minutes-per-night and his usage rate, or the estimated percentage of team possessions a player uses when on-court. is also at a career-high mark.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another big difference this season is his shot selection. Puriefoy is taking a lot more threes and is taking far fewer free throws when compared to prior years. With his best scoring skill being getting to the rim, this could explain some of his struggles.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lately, the junior point guard has been much better with his shooting. Puriefoy shot 5-of-10 from the field against UMBC last Wednesday, and followed that performance up by making 7-of-12 shots against Maine on Saturday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stony Brook can only hope that Puriefoy's performance in those games is a sign that his first half struggles are behind him. The Seawolves will need much more from him down the stretch if they are to be a factor come March.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Point #2: Kameron Mitchell is coming alive</strong></em></p>
<p dir="ltr">On the flip side, another Seawolves guard is on the uptick after some early-season struggles.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Kameron Mitchell began the year as a starter and faced high expectations, as Head Coach Steve Pikiell referred to him as the team’s best perimeter defender. However, shaky defense and his slow shot release relegated him to the pine in place of freshman Bryan Sekunda. Since then, Mitchell’s defense has improved steadily and he had a breakout game against Washington.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Huskies left Mitchell alone a dangerous number of times, and he connected on 4-of-5 threes to lead SBU back into the contest. Mitchell was able to net 12 points that night. his second double-digit game of the year, with the first coming against Division-II St. Thomas Aquinas on Nov. 29.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Following the Washington win, Mitchell scored nine points on 2-2 shooting from the field and had four free throws—a rarity for Mitchell—against new Hampshire. Mitchell never looked more confident, taking it to the basket with determination and being a more active player altogether.</p>
<p dir="ltr">His recent play has been quieter, but if Mitchell can maintain his newly-found swagger and not shy away from his deadly jumper, it will prove huge for Stony Brook in conference play.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Point #3: Defense is the key for Stony Brook's women's basketball team</strong></em></p>
Looking at the Stony Brook women's basketball team's roster, what is most noticeable is its depth. It is the nature of this Seawolves team.

When Sabre Proctor does not have her typical “big” game, Brittany Snow and others are there to pick up the scraps. When Jessica Ogunnorin does not get things going, Kori Bayne-Walker and the rest of the team can come up with timely baskets.

But, it is a matter of keeping other teams in check. Every game in which Head Coach Caroline McCombs’ team has given up fewer than 57 points, it has won. As the Seawolves take on the rest of the America East, continuing to keep the scoring on the lower side will only bode well. When the inevitable clash against Albany comes around, shootouts will not go in favor of the red and white. Including the America East tournament last year, the team’s four losses were all to opponents who scored 61 points are more. This is a defensive team, and they need to show it.

<em><strong>Point #4: Who will be this season’s Kori Bayne-Walker?</strong></em>

Last year, especially when the games got more and more important, there would be moments when the Seawolves looked flat. It was weird, considering how solid of a rebounding team Stony Brook was and still is, earning many second chances a game.

But, a spark was needed. Sophomore Bayne-Walker used her time off the bench to slice through the defense, penetrating the interior of opposing defenses, which would later open things up for the rest of that team.

With Bayne-Walker in the starting lineup this season, who will be the spark off the bench this year? Can junior Kim Hanlon do what fans saw earlier in the season and hit timely shots from the outside, or will the smaller sophomore Kristie Costantino be the one to spark the offense?

Time will tell, but impact of the bench will be of the utmost importance.  With the likes of Albany’s Shereesha Richards and New Hampshire’s Elizabeth Belanger making an impact every minute that they are on the floor, somebody will need to stop their momentum. With every game being important, it is time to find that player.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>By Skyler Gilbert and Joe Galotti
</strong>

The Lions can never seem to beat the Packers at Lambeau Field, Roger Federer can never seem to beat Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros and the Seawolves can never seem to beat the Catamounts at Patrick Gymnasium.

Vermont came out victorious against the visiting Stony Brook men’s basketball team 71-57 on Jan. 10 in Burlington, marking the thirteenth time in fourteen years that the Seawolves fell short at their conference rival’s home gym.

“You’ve got to deserve to win when you come up here [to Burlington],” Head Coach Steve Pikiell said following the loss. “It’s a tough place to play, they’re very good, and we didn’t play well enough to deserve to win the basketball game.”

The Seawolves battled throughout and were able to cut the deficit to five points with 4:09 left in the second half after a pair of Jameel Warney hook shots, but Stony Brook could not get a defensive stop when it mattered most, and Vermont pulled away late.

Warney had 26 points, tying a season-high, along with ten rebounds. The junior center leads the nation with fourteen double-doubles and 12.2 rebounds per game.

The Seawolves offense struggled on their entry passes to Warney early in the game, as UVM’s big men fronted him in the post, holding him to six first-half points.

After some halftime adjustments, the ever-resilient Warney exploded for 20 points in the second half alone—the most he’s had in a single half in his collegiate career. The crowd of green in the bleachers was baffled as Warney continuously made power post moves and acrobatic lay-ups, paying respect to the reigning conference player of the year.

At the other end of the court, Vermont’s lanky and athletic forwards stretched the floor and challenged the interior defense of the Seawolves, exploiting matchup advantages. Using their quickness and shooting ability, Ethan O’Day and Kurt Steidl haunted Stony Brook all game long, scoring sixteen and thirteen points, respectively.

During the second half it, seemed as if Vermont would never miss. The defenders in red were left watching as the Catamounts made floater after floater, three after three. Overall, Vermont had an effective field goal percentage of 59.6 percent in the game, the worst defensive performance of the season for the Seawolves in that regard.

“Their bigs are always mobile and they can shoot the ball. O’Day had a great game for them,” Pikiell noted. “It’s a tough matchup for any players, but especially conventional big guys like we tend to have.”

Stony Brook, with a reputation for being one of the nation’s best at crashing the glass, was out-rebounded by Vermont, 30-26. It was only the third time this season the Seawolves failed to secure more rebounds than their opponent.

Offense, with the exception of Warney, was difficult to come by for the Seawolves. Not one of the Stony Brook guards had more than six points on Saturday. Carson Puriefoy shot just 2-of-12 from the field in the contest.

Puriefoy has never been one to shy from taking shots and despite his shooting slump, Pikiell wants him to keep the same mentality.

“[Carson’s] just in one of those bad spells here," Pikiell said after the loss. "Players go through this at times and we need to get him out of it. That’s the most important thing. He needs to continue to shoot for us. He’s been good throughout his career and I expect him to bounce back soon, and hopefully that’ll come in our next game.”

While Patrick Gym has been a house of horrors for the Seawolves in recent years, the team has had nothing but success playing at Island Federal Credit Union Arena.

Stony Brook continued its winning ways at the new arena on Wednesday, Jan. 14, defeating UMBC 64-54 and improving its record at home to 8-0.

Puriefoy led the way for the Seawolves against the Retrievers, and showed signs that his recent slump may soon be coming to an end. The junior point guard scored a team-high 15 points, shot 5-of-10 from the field and 2-of-2 from behind the arc.

Stony Brook got offensive contributions up and down the lineup in the contest. Roland Nyama finished with 12 points and Warney, Rayshaun McGrew and Kameron Mitchell finished with nine points apiece.

Outside shooting made the difference in the game for the Seawolves, as the team nailed seven three-pointers against UMBC.

Warney, who received a great deal of defensive attention down low from the Retrievers defenders, was thrust into the position of distributor. His ability to pass out of double teams and find open shooters resulted in him finishing with a career-high eight assists on the night.

The game was tightly contested most of the way, with Stony Brook holding only a 50-49 lead, with just under five minutes to play. But, seven unanswered points from Warney helped his team expand their lead to eight and put SBU in full control.

After the victory over UMBC, the Seawolves had an overall record of 11-7 and a 2-1 record in America East conference play.

It was the usual suspects who helped the Stony Brook women’s basketball team get the job done against UMBC last Wednesday night. Sabre Proctor, Brittany Snow and Kori Bayne-Walker all came up large in their team’s America East conference matchup against the Retrievers and helped the Seawolves leave Baltimore with a 66-50 win.

Proctor continued her stellar play this season, finishing with a game-high 20 points and 10 rebounds. The performance marked the 13th time this season she has registered double-digit points.

Snow and Bayne-Walker each added 16 points in the contest, marking the 11th time each player has reached double-digit point totals during the 2014-15 campaign. Snow also finished with nine rebounds in the game, while Bayne-Walker had a team-high five assists.

The victory was Stony Brook’s second conference win of the year. It was also the team's second win away from Island Federal Credit Union Arena this season.

The Seawolves came out of the gate strong, going on an 8-0 run during the game’s first 3:48. But, SBU was unable to pull away from UMBC and the Seawolves found themselves with just a 29-26 lead over the Retrievers at halftime.

Stony Brook missed its first four shots from the field to start the second half, and trailed 33-32 with 16:48 remaining in regulation. 20 seconds later, a jumper by Snow put her team back in the lead. From there the Seawolves took off.

Snow’s jumper started an 18-6 run for Stony Brook. With just over 11 minutes left to play, SBU held an 11-point advantage.

The trio of Proctor, Snow and Bayne-Walker would combine to score the final 16 points of the game for the Seawolves, which helped their team in holding off the Retrievers down the stretch and secured a Seawolves' victory.

Stony Brook’s strong effort on the boards was a big factor in the win. The Seawolves out-rebounded UMBC 38-25 for the game, 23-9 in the second half alone.

SBU’s only two road victories this season have come in the state of Maryland. Stony Brook defeated Morgan State 50-48 in Baltimore back on Dec. 13.

The win over UMBC improved the Seawolves record to 9-7 overall and to 2-1 in conference play.]]></content:encoded>

The junior guard finished with 18 points and five assists on 11 shots in the Seawolves' matchup against Maine on Jan. 17. (HEATHER KHALIFA / THE STATESMAN)[/caption]
<p dir="ltr">In a tale of two antithetical performances, Stony Brook went on the road and ran Maine out of the gym in an 82-39 blowout before returning home to get trumped by Albany, 64-47.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Facing off against the Black Bears on Jan. 17, Stony Brook resembled the conference favorite many expected it to be. After a lingering first nine minutes of the contest, the Seawolves clamped down defensively and began making it rain from deep on the other end. With an 18-16 lead with <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1052410356"><span class="aQJ">11:17</span></span> to go in the first half, Stony Brook went on a 23-0 run to close the period. Three Seawolves finished the first 20 minutes with double-digit scoring, along with two threes apiece coming from freshman Bryan Sekunda, redshirt freshman Roland L’Amour Nyama and junior Carson Puriefoy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The second half was not dissimilar. Stony Brook outscored Maine 41-23, led by Puriefoy, who had his best game since an early-December loss to Providence. Puriefoy finished with 18 points and five assists on 11 shots, while Jameel Warney had 14 points and Nyama added 12 points and a whopping six steals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Against Albany at home, it was a case of same Seawolves, different day for Stony Brook. The same team that sent SBU packing on their home court last March did it again last Monday in convincing fashion and without their best player, Peter Hooley, who went home due to an illness in his family.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“At the end of the day, we didn’t come to play hard,” Warney said following the 17-point loss. “Albany deserved to win this game. There were times where we wanted to play and then there were times where we didn’t want to play at all, and it showed.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Great Danes opened up the game on an 18-5 run, with Stony Brook making only two of its first 11 tries from the field.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I thought we got great looks in the first five minutes tonight. Jameel had a layup and we missed a lot of free throws,” Head Coach Steve Pikiell said after the game. “I thought we were getting the right kind of looks, so I wasn’t worries about that. I told our guys at halftime, ‘if we get good looks like that I know you guys are gonna make some.’ Unfortunately it never really came.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stony Brook did get on a run, however. With Warney not seeing immediate double teams, he began to attack as soon as he caught the ball, leading to eight straight points of his own to spark an 11-0 run for SBU. Freshmen Deshaun Thrower and Tyrell Sturdivant were key players in this momentum swing, both making big plays on each end of the hardwood.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Thrower actually finished with the team’s best +/-, and Puriefoy played one of the worst games of his career. The junior finished with just three points on 1-9 shooting, five turnovers and a +/- of<strong> </strong>-23.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I feel like it’s a team effort. When one man’s down, everybody else got to step up and try to finish what he’s not doing right now,” Rayshaun McGrew, who finished with a double-double, said. “[Puriefoy’s] in a small slump, he’ll get out of it because he’s a great player.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“If [Puriefoy] has a night like this, we’re gonna struggle a little bit,” Pikiell added.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Albany’s Evan SIngletary had a field day against Puriefoy and anyone else Stony Brook threw at him, scoring 21 points and getting to the stripe 11 times. Still, Stony Brook’s first half run kept the Seawolves within striking distance at the break, trailing by just six at halftime. The Great Danes would break the game open following the latter half’s first media timeout, when they switched to a 2-3 zone.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It shouldn’t make a difference. We’ve been seeing zone all season,” Warney said. “We saw zone last game against Maine and we did pretty good against it. I don’t know what happened today.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">What happened was Stony Brook shot just 6-18 from the field and committed eight of their 12 turnovers from that point forward. Perhaps even more staggering was that Albany outrebounded Stony Brook on the evening, making this only the fifth time a team beat the Seawolves on the glass this season.</p>
<p dir="ltr">All this allowed Albany to take a double-digit advantage and essentially ride it to the finish line. The Seawolves did have one last chance at a run, with a McGrew layup and Sekunda three closing the gap to six with under three minutes to play. The Great Danes would hold firm though, making their free throws and winning 64-47 to remain undefeated in America East play.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’re the youngest team in the conference, we’re the 24th youngest team in the country. We have five freshmen that play a major part of what we do. We lost four starters from last year,” Pikiell said. “We’re having a little learning process at times, but we’re pretty good and Albany’s pretty good and they got the better of us today.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Stony Brook women’s basketball team showed plenty of fight in its recent conference matchups against Maine and Albany, but ultimately failed to come away with a victory in either game. The Seawolves dropped a heartbreaker at home to the Black Bears last Saturday, then fell in New York state’s capital two days later.

Against Maine, the Seawolves found themselves down 47-37 with just under five minutes to play in the second half. But, Stony Brook was far from ready to pack it in.

A layup from red-shirt junior guard Miranda Jenkins cut the Black Bears lead to single digits. Then a pair of buckets from senior forward Sabre Proctor pulled the Seawolves within four points with 2:53 remaining in regulation.

25 seconds later, a three-point play was converted by Maine’s Sigi Koizar to put the Black Bears back up by seven. However, Stony Brook was still not ready to quit. Four free throws by Proctor got SBU back within just three points with 48 seconds left on the game clock.

Koizar would come up large once again, converting a layup on a fast break opportunity to give her team a 53-48 advantage. Jenkins then responded for the Seawolves with a layup of her own with 33 seconds left.

A pair of made free throws by Koizar would expand the Black Bears lead back to five before Proctor responded with a clutch three-pointer to make it just a two-point game with 20 seconds remaining.

Stony Brook then quickly fouled Maine’s Mikaela Gustafsson, who would then make 1-of-2 shots from the line. With 11 seconds left, Proctor had a chance to tie the game with a three, but missed the shot.

SBU was able to still maintain possession off the missed shot, and after a Seawolves timeout, junior forward Brittany Snow was able to get to the foul line and cut the Black Bears lead to 56-55. But, with just 3.7 seconds left, Stony Brook was in a desperate position. After a pair of made free throws by Black Bears guard Sophie Weckstrom, Snow was forced to heave a half-court shot at the buzzer. The attempt failed and Maine came away with the 58-55 victory.

Proctor finished with a team-high 16 points for the Seawolves in the game. Sophomore forward Christa Scognamiglio and Snow also reached double-digit point totals for SBU on Saturday.

On Monday, first-year Head Coach Caroline McCombs got her first shot to take on conference powerhouse Albany. In the first half, her team struggled to keep up with the Great Danes, and the Seawolves found themselves trailing 36-24 heading into the break.

Albany outscored the Seawolves, 14-6, in the paint over the first 20 minutes. The Great Danes also scored 18 points off 11 SBU turnovers in the first half. Sophomore guard Kori Bayne-Walker was guilty of four of those giveaways and Proctor was responsible for three.

The Great Danes continued their strong play early on in the second half, and with 10:31 remaining, held a 54-34 lead over Stony Brook. Despite this, the Seawolves would remarkably find their way back into the game.

Senior guard Jessica Ogunnorin, junior forward Alyssa Coiro and Scognamiglio helped spark a 19-6 run for Stony Brook. A three-pointer by Scognamiglio with 3:11 remaining cut Albany’s lead to just seven points.

This would be as close as the Seawolves would get, as SBU was unable to keep up its hot shooting during the game’s final minutes. The Great Danes would hang on for a 69-59 win.

Despite the tough loss, Stony Brook fans can still be pleased with the fact that the Seawolves were able to hang with one of the conference’s top teams on the road, with one of their top players in Snow absent from the lineup and with limited offensive contributions from Proctor and Bayne-Walker.

Proctor, who has been one of the America East’s top scorers this season, failed to make a field goal in 29 minutes of action during Monday night’s contest. Bayne-Walker's performance also left a lot to be desired, as she finished with just five points and turned the ball over six times.

On the flip side Scognamiglio proved once again to be a valuable weapon off the bench, as she drained five three pointers and scored a career-high 19 points in the game. Ogunnorin also stepped up offensively against the Great Danes, finishing with 16 points on 7-of-11 shooting.

The Seawolves have shown that they are capable of hanging with the America East’s top teams, but will need to find a way to play more complete games if they are to have success moving forward. Heading into Thursday's matchup against UMass-Lowell, Stony Brook was 2-3 in America East play and 9-9 overall.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>By Kunal Kohli and Skyler Gilbert</strong>

After a disappointing 64-47 loss at home to Albany on Monday, the Stony Brook men’s basketball team was looking to bounce back in the first game of a two-game road trip.

The Seawolves did just that in their matchup against the UMass-Lowell River Hawks on Thursday night, coming away with a 65-45 victory.

Junior forward Rayshaun McGrew led the team with 15 points and added a team-high eight rebounds, while junior forward Jameel Warney finished with 13 points and seven rebounds.

Stony Brook started the game on an 8-2 run, led by McGrew and freshman point guard Deshaun Thrower, who got his first start of the season over the struggling Carson Puriefoy.

The River Hawks were able to battle back and trailed by only two points with 14:19 left in the first half.

But, the Seawolves responded with an 11-0 run, which gave them a commanding 23-10 advantage as the first half wound down.

The game quickly turned into a blowout, as the Seawolves expanded their lead to 37-16 by the break behind stifling defense and a flowing offense.

The biggest story in the first half was the guard play for the Seawolves.

Thrower had all eight of his points in the first and Puriefoy scored four of his eight points off the bench. Redshirt freshman Roland L’Amour Nyama scored five of his nine points on the night in the game’s first 20 minutes.

Stony Brook got off to a less-than-desireable start to the latter half, going scoreless for nearly the first four minutes.

The Seawolves finally got on the board on a dunk from Warney, who was not very prolific with the entire opposing defense focused on him.

The Seawolves then went on a barrage. The game became the McGrew show, as he scored eight of his 15 in the final half. There were no answers for the Seawolves offense, as Warney and sophomore guard Ryan Burnett, who started in place of freshman Bryan Sekunda, also came alive down the stretch.

The River Hawks tried getting back into the game, even cutting the Seawolves lead to 15 points twice in the second half.

River Hawks leading scorer, freshman guard Matt Harris, had 6-of-12 in the second half, scoring on 3-of-5 three point attempts.

This was not enough for UMass-Lowell though, and SBU coasted to victory.

On Sunday afternoon, behind a career day from Puriefoy, Stony Brook was able to escape Binghamton with a 61-54 victory over the Bearcats.

The Seawolves improved to a 14-8 overall this season and 5-2 in America East conference play.

Binghamton used a 2-3 zone to keep the game competitive for much of the game, but the Seawolves were able to reign supreme with some clutch play from their junior point guard.

After the Bearcats took a 46-45 lead with 5:57 remaining in the second half after a Willie Rodriguez lay-up, Puriefoy responded by scoring fourteen points in the next five minutes to put Stony Brook ahead comfortably for the win.

Puriefoy, back in his usual starting role after coming off the bench against UMass-Lowell on Thursday, had 27 points in the game, enough for a career-high and ending a recent slump in which his shooting percentages were well below his career averages.

The junior point guard attacked the basket throughout the game, earning 13 free throws in the contest while also scoring two crucial lay-ups in transition down the stretch.

Similar to the home game against Albany last week, the Binghamton Bearcats’ 2-3 zone stifled Stony Brook for much of the game and kept most offense to the perimeter.

Forwards Warney and McGrew combined for only eleven points in the game as the Seawolves struggled to find open post-entry passes.

While the Bearcats excelled at denying the Seawolves’ big men the ball, Stony Brook was able to expose some of the zone’s weaknesses with their shooting.

SBU drilled nine threes--one of its best shooting games of the season–including three treys from Puriefoy and Kameron Mitchell.

On the glass, Stony Brook was out-rebounded by Binghamton 38-36.

Warney led the Seawolves with fourteen boards, including five offensive rebounds.

The Seawolves’ victory was the tenth consecutive win against their upstate New York SUNY rivals, giving them a 35-25 all-time record against the Bearcats.

The men’s basketball team will return to action this Wednesday night when it hosts the Hartford Hawks at Island Federal Credit Union Arena.

As the spring semester begins, cooking with friends might be the closest some students get to cooking with their families.

In celebration of the beginning of the semester, a dear friend of mine taught me how to cook up a simple meal that reminded us of home-cooked food.

This week’s College gal cooking will feature lemon garlic pasta with chicken and vegetables made from scratch. This recipe might be easier to make with two or more people.

Garlic is not only a great herb used for flavoring various food, but it is also good for treating or preventing heart and blood system related issues, according to Medicine Plus.

&nbsp;

Ingredients:

1lb Spaghetti or desired pasta

½ cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil

3 tbs minced garlic

6-to-10 tbs lemon juice

4 tsp or 1 cube Chicken Flavor Instant Bouillon

Diced chicken breast or pre-made grilled chicken

⅓ sweet pepper

Mushrooms

Snap peas

Broccoli

Salt

Black pepper

Italian seasoning (optional)

For this recipe, fill a pot with water to boil the pasta. However, do not fill the pot to the top as it will overflow once the water begins to boil.

I used spaghetti for this recipe, but penne, elbow macaroni or other forms of pasta will work as well.

While the water is boiling, prepare the lemon garlic sauce for the pasta. Pour the olive oil into a saucepan and set the stove to medium or medium-high heat.

Then, add the minced garlic. If you can not get garlic, garlic powder may also work.

Once the garlic-infused olive oil turns golden, add a cube of the chicken flavor instant bouillon and six-to-ten tablespoons of lemon juice. Ten tablespoons is not only perfect for those who love lemon sauces, but it also gives the sauce a slight tang without being overpowering.

It is best to wear long sleeves for this, as the oil will begin to bubble once the lemon juice is added. To decrease the bubbling, lower the temperaure the stove to medium-low and make sure the ingredients for the sauce mix evenly.

Do not forget about to add the pasta to the boiling water as you are making the sauce. If the pasta begins cooking during the sauce preparation, both the pasta and the sauce will be ready around the same time.

If you purchase raw chicken breast, add salt and pepper or desired spices to quickly season the meat.

I seasoned the chicken with salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, diced onions, parsley and cilantro two days before making this dish.

This, however, is not necessary as simple salt and pepper or premade grilled chicken—found in the frozen food section—will also suffice.

Add the chicken to the sauce and let is cook. Keep an eye on the sauce if using premade grilled chicken so that it does not overcook.

Once the chicken is partially cooked, you can add your desired vegetables. For al dente vegetables, wait until the chicken is mostly cooked to add them

Turn the heat down to medium-low for the sauce once the vegetables are added.

Mix the chicken and vegetables in the sauce and leave the sauce on low heat to allow the oil to reduce.

To check if the chicken is cooked, use a spoon to make an incision in the chicken. If it cuts easily, the chicken should be ready.

Once the pasta is cooked, drain the water and add the pasta to the lemon garlic sauce with the chicken and vegetable and mix.

Decrease the heat to mix all of the ingredients. When all the ingredients are mixed evenly, the dish is ready to serve.

Bon Appétit.

In “Still Alice,” Julianne Moore delivers such a heartbreakingly honest portrayal of a woman suffering from early-onset Alzheimer’s disease.

Her acting is so painstakingly believable that it is almost impossible to separate reality from the film and to remove oneself from the experiences and struggles that Alice, the main character, faces.

Moore does an incredible job portraying the helpless feeling of utterly losing everything that makes you yourself from the moment the film begins.

In an opening scene celebrating Alice’s birthday, her character unknowingly hints signs of her disease when she makes an irrelevant comment at dinner. From there on, the accomplished linguistics professor at Columbia University falls further into the downward spiral of memory loss that is defining of Alzheimer’s.

Moore’s dramatic skill is heightened by the cinematic excellence when Alice is jogging on Columbia’s campus, a familiar and comfortable place, and suddenly she is overwhelmed and not sure of where she is. As the camera focuses on Alice’s face and the background blurs beyond recognition and begins to spin it is impossible to not feel completely flooded with confusion.

As Alice’s mind further deteriorates, she sees no choice but to tell her otherwise unnoticing family about her struggles.

In frustration and inability to sleep, Alice wakes her husband in the early hours of the morning to confess “It feels like my brain is f*****g dying!” She then questions why he doubts what she knows.

Early in her disease, Alice creates a video message to her later self.

The video instructs Alice to kill herself through the use of prescription pills if she can no longer remember simple personal questions such as her daughters name or her own birthday.

She labels the folder “Butterfly” after a memory of her late mother in which her mother explains that butterflies may have short lives, but that their lives were beautiful. This sentiment Alice links to her
own life.

The directors of the film, Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland, add depth by linking the disease suffered by Alice to the play “Angels in America” by Tony Kushner. Alice’s younger daughter, an aspiring actress, reads the renowned closing scene, which portrays the beautiful image of souls leaving the ground and ascending into the air.

She asks her mother what it is about and, fighting to pronounce the word love. Moore sends a powerful message.

The message is that Alzheimer’s is not the disease of social rejects or that only afflicts the elderly, as many believe it does. While it may not have a cure, Moore captures how it can only be treated by love.

Having recently won the Golden Globe for Best Actress for her role in “Still Alice,” Moore has yet another nomination for an Oscar for Best Actress. The people of the Internet have strong hopes for a win.

The team was first founded in 1958 as a varsity sport, but since the 1990s, it has been a club sport. <em>PHOTO CREDIT : STONY BROOK CREW</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Stony Brook Crew team has been around since the campus was located in Oyster Bay, and has been growing little by little each year.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We’re one the largest clubs at Stony Brook so I’m surprised we’re not very well-known on campus,” Crew treasurer Timothy Hart said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hart is in charge of the nearly $30,000 budget. </span>When the team was first founded in 1958 with only one shell to practice with, it was a varsity sport, but since the 90s, it has been a club sport.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The team consistently <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9507E2DB143AEF3BBC4D53DFB3668383679EDE">placed in the top three</a> at the Metropolitan Championships during its varsity years, and this was highlighted in the New York Times.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to the team’s secretary David Harary, Stony Brook Varsity Crew was the first team to bring home a medal for the university at the Oyster Bay campus when it won its prize against Kent State University in Ohio.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“In the past year and a half, we have had increased success in regattas,” Harary said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The team won a silver and bronze at the 2014 Frostbite regatta, while taking home a gold and a bronze at the Fall Mets in 2014. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Harary went on to say that the club team manages everything themselves, from organizing practices, hiring coaches, purchasing equipment and organizing the trips for regattas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Just getting to a regatta is a big deal for us, with the maintenance of equipment and all of the steps required, so working hard and watching our team succeed is even more gratifying,” Harary said about the work they put in to make the club successful. “It’s like cooking a delicious meal versus ordering one at a restaurant.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If the club were to return to varsity status, then it would not have control over its coaches and it would not allow anyone with interest to join.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The team also competes against NCAA women’s crew teams and varsity-funded men’s athletic crew teams. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are four female rowers and three female coxswains.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I get to wake up at 4 a.m. and see the sunrise everyday,” sophomore vice president Talia Brown said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I’ve been on the team since the beginning of my freshman year, and I love it.” Brown went on to say that the team is co-ed, but races are divided by gender. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She says she likes the environment because she is not practicing with only girls.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The team trains all semester long with very early practices.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The team has practice Monday through Friday from 5:30-7:30 a.m. in the Stony Brook Harbor out of the Knox School, or in the CREC from 6 a.m. to 7:30 a.m. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the fall, there are longer races, but shorter races in the spring.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The camaraderie and competition at regattas is unlike any other sports community,” Harary said. </span>“Because of the expense of organizing a regatta, many times high school, college, and sometimes national and international competitions all occur during the same weekend. It is very inspiring for all levels of rowing to compete around the others.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Psychology meets computer science to help animals **HOLD**</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As a young girl, Stony Brook University senior psychology major Elizabeth Crowe could not go to the shelter to volunteer, but faced with a “computing for good” assignment, she was finally able to help her favorite species: dogs.

Crowe came up with the idea of “dogs with blogs” as her honors senior thesis to investigate human tendencies towards adopting pets. The blogs are created by student volunteers who give a personality to the dogs, as opposed to just the height, weight and breed.

“We’re trying to determine two things: does a blog help a dog get adopted because there is more personalized information…but the other thing we won’t be able to know until we have a long term study is does this help to prevent the kind of return rate,” Anthony Scarlatos, a computer science professor who is helping Crowe build her application, said.

The goal of Crowe’s new application, called “Shelterware,” is to help shelters work more efficiently by streamlining processes and helping dogs get adopted and stay with their new families. The project officially launches in May.

“The act of going to the shelter, walking these dogs, playing with them, increases dog sociability which in turn actually does increase their adoptability and makes it less likely that they’re going to be returned because they don’t have as many behavioral problems,” Crowe said of her application.

Scarlatos said shelters like the Smithtown Animal Shelter have faced many issues with adoption return rates. When some adopters realize that they do not want the dog, they either gave the dog back to another shelter claiming the dog was a stray out of embarrassment or they let the dog loose. This can be devastating for the dog.

The application will have both a web and mobile end. The mobile application allows animals to be photographed and the photo uploaded to the Shelterware database at any time.

If someone finds a lost animal, he or she can scan the Quick Response bar code on the dog’s tag. Senior computer science major Matt Lagueras originally worked this on as a separate project for Professor Scarlatos’ benevolent computing class Crowe teamed up with Lagueras through Scarlatos, who taught Crowe’s Honors College course.

If the animal does not have its own code, Shelterware allows users to snap a picture and upload it to the application on their smart devices. The GPS location and time stamp are then added to the database.

According to Scarlatos, this increases efficiency for the Smithtown Animal Shelter, where the project is being implemented. Filing papers is space intensive and also requires human hands in order to organize it, leaving less people to take care of the dogs. The program will alleviate the need for paper documents by going digital.

The project had its setbacks. The shelter only had six dogs at the time of the study. For the purposes of research, Crowe decided to accumulate her data from a random sampling of 30 dogs. Crowe used “Petfinder”, a pet adoption website, to select the dogs and then used a coin toss to which choose which dogs would have blogs.

“[Crowe] doesn’t want to have the most popular breeds of dogs who would be adopted anyways to also have blogs,” Scarlatos said.

Lagueras took charge of the technical side of the application.

Crowe’s idea stemmed from something that is popular within many universities: petting puppies in order to relieve stress. But Crowe knew that there could be a more beneficial response to stress that could help both the students and the dogs.

“It felt really good to give back to those who aren’t in a position to help themselves,” Crowe said. “It’s nice to see that things like Facebook or Twitter can be used for something more than saying how much life sucks; it can be used to actually help the community and increase a sense of involvement.”

Crowe also liked how the project gave people a sense of purpose. According to Crowe’s observations, by posting blogs on the Internet for these animals, it made volunteers feel good, and it reinvigorated her own sense of optimism.

“If you look on the app store, so many apps will be things like ‘where’s my car?’ or ‘let me know when the laundry is done,’” Lagueras said. “There is not enough effort being put into computing for good.”]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Rumble in the Desert: ISIS v. Taliban BF****HT HOLD****</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_39987" align="alignleft" width="300"]<img class="wp-image-39987 size-half-width" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/WORLD_NEWS_ISLAMICSTATE-JIHADIJOHN_1_ZUM-300x417.jpg" alt="ZUMA PRESS / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE" width="300" height="417" /> Mohammed Emwazi, above, gained notoriety last year as the masked man in the ISIS beheading videos. A native of London, Emwazi is among many westerners who have joined ISIS, giving ISIS an advantage in recruitment over the Taliban. <em>ZUMA PRESS / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE</em>[/caption]

In mid-April, two of the largest, most brutal terrorist groups in recent memory decided that enough was enough; there could be only one.

ISIS, the Islamic State of Syria, otherwise known as ISIL, the Iraq/Islamic State of the Levant, has declared a Jihad, or <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=jihad&amp;oq=jihad&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l3j69i60j0.1704j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=jihad+definition">“a war or struggle against unbelievers,”</a> </strong>on its counterpart, the Taliban. Upon hearing that it was being called out, the Taliban responded with a Jihad of its own, showing it will not be dissed on the global stage.

Obviously, these two groups do not want to be defeated by the other. One of these groups will prevail and prove their group is the world’s most dangerous state (barring N.W.A., of course).

Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, insulted Mullah Mohammad Omar Mujahid, the leader of the Taliban, by calling him <a href="http://www.mintpressnews.com/isis-taliban-announce-jihad-against-each-other/204634/">“a fool and illiterate warlord.”</a> By doing this, he more or less asserted claim that he and his rag tag group of <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2015/02/04/mideast-crisis-children-idINKBN0L828E20150204">child crucifiers</a> were more extreme than the (Pakistani) Taliban, a group who took pride in its previous<a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/pakistan-school-massacre/peshawar-school-massacre-splits-afghan-pakistani-militant-groups-n271706"> massacre of school children.</a>

In order to paint a clear picture of what this proverbial cage match is going to look like, let’s take an analytic look at the advantages and disadvantages of each group.

For starters, ISIS has the upper hand in terms of recruitment. Unlike its Afghani counterparts, many who flock to ISIS are not necessarily natives of either Iraq or Syria. Instead, they come from countries all around the world, including Western nations like <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/05/us/isis-us-arrests/">Britain, France and the United States.</a>

On the other hand, the Taliban mainly recruit from within Afghanistan and Pakistan, with two distinct groups being set up in each country. The Pakistani Taliban, though “independent” of the main Afghani Taliban, are allied to the latter. Still, this recruiting ground of only two countries puts the Taliban at a severe disadvantage; by not having the capability to recruit from countries all around the world, it will be in a disadvantaged position if a war break out.

Therefore, I feel it is appropriate to say ISIS wins the advantage this round.

Though ISIS may have a larger recruiting ground, it is inexperienced in conventional warfare. The only tactics it seems to understand are killing defenseless children, people who cannot fight back, and themselves. In comparison, the Taliban has the advantage of being in a constant state of war since its formation. The Taliban has fought against multiple groups that have generally been technologically superior to it in weapons and tactics. Although the Taliban also <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/pakistan-school-massacre/peshawar-school-massacre-splits-afghan-pakistani-militant-groups-n271706">relishes killing </a>children (though it does not obtain the shock factor like ISIS crucifixion does), the Taliban still has combat experience which definitely comes in handy when the time warrants it.

Round two goes to the Taliban.

With the score tied at 1 to 1, let’s delve into the physical brutality of each group.

Though it is safe to say that both groups are deadly and sadistically murderous, it seems that the Taliban might have the advantage when it comes to sheer number of people killed. According to vocativ.com, which provided data released by ISIS from October 2013 to May 2014 and from the Taliban from 2011, the Taliban killed nearly 1,999 people a month on average, which is about ten times more than ISIS’ measly 208 people.

On top of this, the Taliban on average, killed<a href="http://www.vocativ.com/world/afghanistan-world/isis-vs-taliban-2/"> two people per “attack,” as compared to ISIS only killing one person for every five attacks. </a>Talk about inefficiency on ISIS’ behalf.

ISIS’ inability to effectively utilize the element of surprise brings the tally up 2-1 in favor of Omar’s Taliban.

So even though the Taliban are, statistically, deadlier than ISIS, why is it that we never hear about it in the news?

The answer to this question lies within the fact that ISIS is utilizing social media, a term that seems to be completely foreign to the Taliban. ISIS utilizes video releases highlighting why some members have joined and even have a <a href="https://news.vice.com/article/isis-has-a-really-slick-and-sophisticated-media-department">video portraying happy children receiving ice cream</a> from smiling ISIS members.

These videos are making ISIS look like it is going to be a grand ole’ time. When not cutting the heads off of prisoners of war or nailing metal spokes through the appendages of a four-year-old infidel, you too can live out the dream of being an ice cream man!

In addition to this, ISIS video tapes all of its brutal executions and acts of violence, using it as propaganda to get even more hopeful Jihadi’s to join the cause.

After this round is all said and done, it looks like the score is even 2-2.

So who will win this match? Hopefully both groups are extremely successful eliminating one another, though something makes me feel like that will not happen.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Almonds are killing California</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[**by Joseph Whearty** &lt; that means he's a newbie

&nbsp;

In the last couple years, the Golden State has turned more to a dusty, dry yellow as it is caught in the grips of a historic drought. Officials have taken charge to combat the crisis by instituting statewide cutbacks on water use, but despite their best efforts there is still a major issue in the form of a tiny nut and its $6.5 <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-65-billion-almond-crop-is-driving-the-sharp-debate-about-california-water-use-2015-4" target="_blank">billion</a> industry. While Californians are struggling to limit their water use, almond farmers are draining the state of its groundwater to support the growing industry. With almond growers and investors showing no signs of limiting their activities, the responsibility falls on the public to cut our consumption of California almonds in order to decrease their demand and preserve California’s water.

Since roughly 2005, the consumption of almonds has skyrocketed in the U.S. so much that it, in 2014, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/08/06/the-rise-of-the-american-almond-craze-in-one-nutty-chart/" target="_blank">dethroned</a> America’s long time favorite, the peanut, as the country’s most popular nut. Their demand has also been strengthened by an unprecedented growth in popularity in China. While a widespread popularity in a trendy, healthy snack seems harmless, that carton of almond milk or bag of the nuts prove to be more nefarious when you realize that it takes a gallon of water to produce a single almond and that the total California almond industry, which produces about 80% of the world’s almonds, requires more than a trillion gallons of water a year.

One might think that with Californians being expected to decrease their use of water, hundreds of wild elk <a href="http://thoughtcatalog.com/james-b-barnes/2015/04/elk/" target="_blank">dying</a> of thirst, and bodies of water decreasing to <a href="http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/California-Drought-Images-Now-Then-Before-After-Comparison-298456561.html" target="_blank">fractions</a> of their normal area, almond growers might think twice about planting new almond trees, but that is not the case. Despite the drought conditions, the majority of California almond farmers are still determined to expand the industry and plant more almond trees. I believe that this demonstrates a disappointing lack of social responsibility on the part of almond farmers. But who could be surprised when they are tempted by returns as high as 30%? I, for one, am not. When given the option, any business owner would likely choose the more profitable course regardless of its implications.

Unfortunately, us on the east coast have little ability to combat California’s drought. We cannot mail water across the country and we certainly cannot control the weather and send them rain. But as consumers, we do have one power. We can help to decide which products make money and which do not.

So I plan to stop buying almond products and I encourage you all to do the same. Then maybe when their profits sink, almond farmers will reduce the cultivation of their crop. Until this crisis is over, I can stand to eat walnuts or help the peanut take back its place as top of the nut hierarchy. And I can switch back to cow’s milk. It’s creamier anyway.

While the drought is a complicated issue and the boycotting of almonds will not solve everything, I believe it is a step in the right direction, even if it is just to show the almond industry that we will care about California’s well being when they won’t.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A third grade teacher in Denver recently gave her students a writing <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2015/04/17/i-wish-my-teacher-knew-poignant-notes-from-students/" target="_blank">assignment</a>—to finish the prompt “I wish my teacher knew...”  Some of the answers were truly heartbreaking.  In honor of this teacher’s attempt to better connect with our students, we took our own poll of what Stony Brook students wish their professors knew.  Listen up professors, it’s time for you to learn.

One of the most common responses I received from students is they all wished their professors could understand their workload.  We are all taking multiple classes along with jobs, family obligations, and extracurricular activities.  We don’t have time to read 25 chapters in one weekend when every other class is assigning the same workload.  A similar but separate comment was on how the schedule of athletes is not conducive to the amounts of work teachers give.  Duly noted, student athletes, but it isn’t just you.

Another response that I received often enough to warrant attention is the students who wished their professors knew that their recent performance in school is because they are suffering from depression.  Too many students here understand this pain and I thank the students who spoke up about this.  There are some professors that truly care about their students.  I have also had a number of students wishing their professors knew how much their help in a time of need was appreciated.  However, more professors need to be aware of the students still struggling, still not receiving that help so we don’t have any more students wishing their professors could understand their depression.

Two also very common and in my opinion, unnecessary comments were the students who wished their professors spoke English, and knew that they wanted to perform certain physical acts with them that would be more appropriate for <i>The Sexwolf</i> column rather than this article.  To these students, save these comments for YikYak.

Some other interesting and notable responses: I wish my professors knew…

&nbsp;

I make jokes in class when I don’t understand something so I don’t look stupid.

Ph.D. is not spelled G.O.D.

If the average for a test is 50%, the majority of kids only understood half of the information that will be needed in more difficult classes.

How to teach slower.

We are adults and shouldn’t be treated like children.

How little effort I put into my A- papers.

Putting a problem into Excel doesn’t teach anyone anything.

I memorized an entire book to try and get an A on the final.

When they say you can’t do an entire project in one night, they’re completely wrong.

How hard I study.

I still have a crush on them two years after graduating.

How much I appreciated the help when I needed someone to talk to.

That they’re brilliant and I love their intelligence.

&nbsp;

And I would like to add my two cents.  I wish my professors knew that I am in awe of how much they understand and I appreciate all the knowledge that they’ve given me.  And maybe a little bit of the “physical act” stuff mentioned before.

Take notes, professors.  This is what you’re students want you to know.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_40193" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="size-full-width wp-image-40193" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/150404_MLAXvsPrinceton_Manju.Shivacharan_1331-600x400.jpg" alt="MANJU SHIVACHARAN / THE STATESMAN" width="600" height="400" /> The Stony Brook men's lacrosse team, above, fell to the Albany in the America East Championship on Saturday May 2nd.  The Great Danes outscored Stony Brook 13-4 in the second half, contributing to the 22-9 victory. <em>MANJU SHIVACHARAN / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

Big-time players come through in big-time games. Albany’s star senior attackman Lyle Thompson did it again, tallying six points and leading the Albany Great Danes to their third straight America East Men’s Lacrosse championship, defeating the second-seeded Stony Brook Seawolves 22-9.

This is Albany’s third straight America East Championship crown and they broke the conference’s record for most goals in the title game in the process.

The passing of the throne from Thompson, who will go down as one of the best Men's Lacrosse players ever, could very well be to freshman attackman Connor Fields, and he had himself a day, tallying four goals and adding four assists.

Thompson tallied all five of his goals in the first half, including scoring the first three for the Great Danes who had two separate 4-0 runs in the first half to go into the break up 8-5, and then used another one to take control early in the third quarter.

The second-half dominance would not stop there, as Albany went on to outscore Stony Brook 13-4 in the final 30 minutes after the Seawolves hung tough for the first 30, including a 7-1 fourth quarter in favor of the Great Danes.

After the Seawolves took a 2-0 lead, the defending co-Tewaaraton award winner did it all on his own. To get the Great Danes on the board he cut in front of the net and bounced it past sophomore goalie Hayden Johnstone to make it 2-1.

He then proceeded to give the Great Danes a lead after a very long possession culminated in Thompson whipping it home from about eight yards out to give Albany a 3-2 advantage, something they would not relinquish for the remainder of the matchup.

After allowing a fourth goal, Stony Brook cut the lead back to 4-3 as senior attackman Mike Rooney floated a pass from behind the goal to sophomore midfielder Ryan Bitzer who fired it past Albany junior goalkeeper Blaze Riorden.

The late-quarter goal momentum was quickly erased as Adam Osika took the ball and walked right through a mishap in Stony Brook’s defense to make it 5-3 Great Danes.

Thompson then scored his final two goals of the game, both from the “x” and going to either side of the goal, with the latter of the two with a very nice scooping goal to make it 8-3 Albany.

Midfielders Jeff Reh and Challen Rogers were able to cut the Seawolves lead to 8-5 with 8:19 to play in the first half, but that is as close as they would get the rest of the way.

Four different Great Danes scored in a six-goal third quarter, with Fields leading the way with a hat trick and an assist for the Great Danes to take a commanding 15-8 lead heading into the final period.

It was six different players wearing purple and gold jerseys in the fourth quarter of the matchup, including sophomore attackman Bennett Drake and freshman midfielder Kyle McClancy adding their lone goals of the contest.

Senior attackman Mike Rooney was held relatively silent in what was quite possibly his final game of his storied Stony Brook career, only accumulating four points on the morning, under his average of 6.3 per game coming into the title game.

While Albany grabbed the automatic bid to the NCAA Men’s Lacrosse Tournament by winning the America East Conference, Stony Brook will have to wait out, and most like sweat out, the selection show on Sunday night to see if their resume impresses the committee enough for an at-large bid.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Is the Press really &quot;Free?&quot;</title>

On Jan. 7, 2015, three armed gunmen stormed the office of the French satrical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and killed 12 people including the Editor in Chief, Stéphane Charbonnier, multiple cartoonists and one police officer.

While the causes of the attack were initially unknown, later reports and videos of the incident showed the three gunmen, who were later found to be members of the Al-Qaeda’s Yemen Branch, yelling “Allahu Akbar,” meaning “God is Great” in Arabic, while they stormed the office of Charlie Hebdo.

It was later found out that the attack was carried out in retaliation for a cartoon Charlie Hebdo published about the Islamic prophet, Muhammad.

As the dust started to settle and people started to realize what exactly happened to the newspaper, the idea of freedom of the press was once again called into question.

People all over the world started to wonder exactly how much freedom the press was allowed in terms of speaking about and depicting religion as well as mocking it. All around the world, people started to use the hashtag “#jesuischarlie” (“I am Charlie” in French) to show their support of not only the paper, but also the idea of freedom of speech.

However, one starts to wonder about the freedom of the press in regards to what it is allowed to say when the possibility of a terrorist attack is ever-looming. Is the press truly “free” if they refuse to publish an article, picture, or idea because they are afraid that putting out their material could lead to the deaths of writers, cartoonists and editors?

In addition, is the press truly free if they face violent and sometimes deadly retaliation due to publishing one single article about a subject?

While I understand that the subject in question is very touchy and is a “hot-button” issue, it cannot be said that the press, with special regards to satirical newspapers in particular, should refuse to publish any sort of material on one of said hot-button issues. If you refuse to mock one idea, than you cannot mock any ideas.

In a twisted sense, satirical publications have to follow the “South Park” rule, where basically states that you can mock everything or you mock nothing at all.

You cannot say that a satirical publication should not publish a picture of Muhammad French-kissing a writer because then you are showing some sort of favoritism to a particular idea, which goes against the whole “mock everything or nothing” rule.

So, is the press really free? Is freedom being afraid for your life for publishing a picture?

In my eyes, freedom of the press is not refusing to publish material due to the looming fear of a terrorist attack. That is not “freedom.”

Freedom is publishing what you want without being fearful of retaliation from a bunch of cowards whose pasttime is killing innocent women and children because they did not listen to their dogma.

So while not everyone is “Charlie,” the deaths of the publications’ writers, editors and cartoonists should not be in vain. People should remember them not as victims of a tragic attack, but rather as martyrs for free speech.

To those whose lives were taken, which includes not only the mainly-atheist staff of Charlie Hebdo but also the Islamic police officer who was tragically killed by gutless cravens, may you rest in peace.

Hopefully, your lives will not be in vain, and may those who committed this heinous crime be properly judged in either this life or the next.

In a rare and fleeting feat of government competence, the Undergraduate Student Government chose to listen to the voices of the masses and bring a rock(ish) act to our school on the brook. The band they chose, Streetlight Manifesto, is one of the finest from the ska-punk scene and will be playing at SAC Ballroom A on Jan. 29.

After being given numerous rap themed acts, many students have been clamoring for a rock group to grace our hallowed halls, and USG has finally delivered.

Having the unfortunate fate to hail from New Jersey, Streetlight Manifesto is inspired by two other ska-punk bands native to the Garden State: the pioneering Catch 22 and the occasionally-stomachable One Cool Guy, with Streetlight’s frontman and creative mastermind Tomas Kalnoky coming from the former.

The band’s style is a mind-boggling blend of ska, punk, hardcore, jazz, rock and roll, reggae, Americana, acoustic, alternative rock, Latin, Gypsy, classical, Klezmer and rap, all performed at a blisteringly fast pace that leads one to entertain suspicions of severe crank abuse before each performance.

Having been to multiple Streetlight Manifesto performances, I can verify that when the sound guy does not turn up the bass so loud that you can not hear the guitar. the band is fantastic and plays some incredible ska.

The horns are on point, the guitar is rocking and the vocals are delivered at lightning speed, belting out brilliantly crafted lyrical missives on love, death, religion, politics, philosophy and life.

Streetlight has a level of songwriting, technical skill and creativity that is not just rare in the ska scene, but that is also very difficult to find anywhere else.

All students who got a ticket made the right choice. Those who did not…you should sit and think about where your life is going right now.

Speaking of the ska scene, a caveat about Streetlight’s genre is worth noting. Ska is a genre characterized by a walking bass line, guitar focused on the upbeats of the measure and (usually) a jazzy horn section. The genre went through three major waves of activity, the first establishing the genre in the 50s, the second giving it a resurgence in the U.K. (and later the U.S.) with roots in the punk and anti-racist skinhead subculture during the late 70s and the third infusing it with American punk rock in the late 80s through the 90s.

This transformation has gotten to the point that the ska-punk is sometimes more of a subgenre of punk than of ska for some bands.

Nominally, Streetlight Manifesto is a ska band from the third wave of ska, as the group’s music sounds much more like really complex punk rock with horns (certainly much more than almost any other ska band).

But Streetlight manifesto’s music is so complex and strays from the generic ska formula by incorporating many other genres that the purist hipsters, which make up a large part of the ska fanbase consider Streetlight to be not “real” ska.

Conversely, some Streetlight fanatics (as the term “fan” is far too moderate to describe them) consider the band so unlike other third wave ska bands and proclaim that due to its very late entry to the scene, the band is the leader of a fourth wave of ska.

Among the purists and the fanatics, the question of what is “real” ska is akin to asking Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush who the “real” Republican is; that is, it is only good for starting fights.

But for the sane (who, admittedly, are hard to find in a scene best characterized by a bunch of sweaty teenagers wearing fedoras and dancing by kicking their arms and legs in alternating fashion while running around in circles to the same exact beat, song after song, for two hours straight), that backstory is irrelevant.

Streetlight Manifesto plays incredible music, regardless of genre, and all students would be well served to show up to the SAC Ballroom and prepare to run around in circles for hours.

Unfortunately, despite what some third party websites say, you cannot (legally) bring in non-SBU students to the show. So if you have non-SBU friends, congratulations on having friends! We really did not think that would happen.]]></content:encoded>

(STATESMAN STOCK PHOTO)[/caption]

“Ring ring!” Off goes my infuriating alarm on my phone. Jesus, it is only seven in the morning and all I can wish for is to prolong my slumber on this foreign, school-provided bed padded with a sheet of foam.

I know I have to get up. I have to comply with what I signed up for. And sometimes I question, “Why?” Well anyway, time to brush these germs from my gums.

Five minutes later I am in the bathroom. Great! Two sinks already occupied.

But this arrangement, though?! These morons cannot be respected. Not only are their brains inverted, but also look at the obscenity of the hygienic disorder they have caused.

For the next ten minutes of brushing and combing, I really do enjoy glancing at the aerosoled pus on the mirror and the mucus of yellow and green shades on the drains.

Back in my room, I have little time to spare to decide what to put on.

This is the most complicated part of the day. No, not the clothes. It is sleeping beauty on the other side of the room.

I need to be extra careful with my motion, be as inaudible as possible to avoid further conflict and plunging into another invidious dispute like last night.

At last I take my stuff and find myself at West Side Dining at the Corner Café purchasing a small cappuccino and a chocolate chip cookie. Total: $6.32. Ahem, definitely a reasonable price for this superlative quality and amount I am getting.

Well, that leaves me with another eight dollars to spend throughout the day with this gold plan.

On the way to Frey Hall, I munch and force myself to luxuriate my nutritional investments.

It is always quiet and full in this organic chemistry lecture. This room is filled with studious students, most with a headstrong desire to become doctors. They all want to “help people.”

My friend Jillian joins me before lecture starts. We exchange in rants about our roommates and have a moment of laughter that makes this early lecture bearable.

Lecture begins and my cognition ends. Good thing I have Jillian to take notes on these irrelevant Diels-Alder reactions. What can I do with my time? Ah, let me check Instagram.

I mean I really do care about the thin-crusted pizza that George got last night.

It is finally nine. I am gleeful to exit this building. My next and last class is at four. Now I have the perfect opportunity to catch up on some sleep.

I’m back in this prison-like complex of a dormitory and rapt to witness my sullen roommate awake. He is currently on his significant career conquest, trying to invade the enemy turrets on “League of Legends.”

His enraged mouse clicking gave me second thoughts on sleep. I proceed to browse Netflix for the next five and a half hours.

Admittedly, my choice of sitcom is no different than yours. I laugh whenever the show decides to play those chortle soundboards.

Darn! Five and a half hours thrown directly into the trash. Time is a metaphysical reality.

It had no plans to stop while I was dwelling into “Everybody Loves Raymond.”
Now I’m rushing to the very important DEC poetry class that Jim recommended, convincing me that it was easy. Never again will I fall into that trap.

Listening to this brash professor lecture makes me sick. This is a discussionary class where you have no opinion because your opinion is wrong, and the only fact in this class is the professor’s opinion.

Even if you think you understand the material in this class, the hammer always comes down on your head during the midterm. Well, at least I am a victim.

Eventually it is 5:30, and again I am elated to leave another class. I meet up with my friend, Steven, at the SAC.

My meal consisting of mozzarella sticks and fries was valued at only about $9, but enough of the same story. Anyway, Steven and I planned for tonight.

We decide to invite a couple of close friends to his suite in Kelly Quad. I mean it is not like the same, or similar, thing happens every night.

We are here to build bonds with friends and have fun for the four years that we are here down in the Brook.

What better way to do that than smoking some claimed-to-be green crack weed and getting trashed with Svedka?

This is an escape from real life. There are no regrets for this hour of the day. Nor will there be by day’s end.

Do you recognize yourself within this character?]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The State University of New York Board of Trustees voted unanimously on Jan. 13<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to approve an new affiliation agreement between Stony Brook University Hospital and Southampton Hospital.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s2">She also said 25 of Southampton Hospital’s 125 beds will be transferred to Stony Brook, the CEO of Southampton will become that Chief Administrative Officer and report to Stony Brook University Hospital’s CEO and a joint advisory committee with members of both hospitals will advise Southampton on strategic initiatives.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">The agreement needs to go through several New York state agencies, including the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the State Comptroller and the Department of Health.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Not only will it help to expand medicine and medical innovation by enhancing education and research, it will also increase clinical training sites and potential sites and participation for medical research and trials,” Dr. Kenneth Kaushansky, the dean of Stony Brook University’s School of Medicine, said in a press release.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SUNY Trustee Eunice Lewin spoke highly of Southampton Hospital during the board meeting.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I was pleasantly surprised by the diversity of patients and commitment to health care for migrant workers and also the Shinnecock Indian nation,” she said. “I believe this affiliation will strengthen both institutions and enhance medical education and training for our students and residents and expand healthcare in Eastern Long Island.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Under the SUNY Board of Trustees’ resolution, neither SUNY nor the state would fund any new construction or renovations at Southampton Hospital.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Southampton Hospital and the 603-bed Stony Brook University Hospital have been formally affiliated since 2008, as the Berger Commission recommended in 2006.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Leadership from both hospitals signed a nonbinding letter of intent in 2012 that called for Southampton to join the Stony Brook Medicine healthcare system.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The letter of intent also called for Southampton Hospital to raise funds for the construction of a new hospital on Stony Brook University’s Southampton campus. The new hospital would replace Southampton Hospital’s current facilities, which opened in 1909.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s4">The SUNY Board of Trustees adopted another resolution in May of 2014, stating that the board “supports the activity of development of viable, long term regional health networks and collaborations by its hospitals.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">That same month, Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn closed after it affiliated with SUNY Downstate Medical Center, costing Downstate millions of dollars.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Two other hospitals, Peconic Bay Medical Center in Riverhead and Eastern Long Island Hospital in Greenport, are also in affiliation talks with Stony Brook.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

(SYLWIA TUZINOWSKA / THE STATESMAN)[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stony Brook psychology professor Turhan Canli has a radical idea on the cause of depression, a condition that is estimated by the CDC to affect one in 10 Americans.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a paper published in “Biology of Mood and Anxiety Disorders,” Canli proposed that depression might actually be caused by a traditional infectious agent, whether it be a bacteria, virus or parasite.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For something that has been traditionally seen as a psychological issue or even a genetic issue, the thought of depression as an infectious disease is very unorthodox.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Its a very unexplored way of thinking about it,” Canli said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Canli’s proposal comes from the discovery of inflammatory biomarkers in depressed patients. Inflammation is a major facet of the body’s immune system—the stuffy nose one feels during a cold, the red nose of allergies and the fever of the flu are all examples of inflammation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We currently don’t have a well-defined problem to solve,” Canli said. “We’re not really treating depression, we’re just messing with the symptoms. If you’re lucky, if you have major depression, you get something prescribed, and it might work. It might not work, in which case they up the dose or switch you to some other medication until they find something works. That’s not a very satisfying way to treat illness. It’s very much trial and error.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Eighty percent of sufferers of clinical depression receive no treatment for their condition, according to the CDC.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are several hallmarks of the brain in depressed patients. Sufferers of depression have low levels of certain chemicals called neurotransmitters. Canli said. Neurotransmitters are a type of messenger chemical and when the make their way to the cells of the brain, they cause the brain to react in a specific way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The neurotransmitters depressed patients lack include serotonin, epinephrine and dopamine, and the message those neurotransmitters carry is related to moods such as anxiety, pleasure and energy. Common antidepressants increase the levels of
these neurotransmitters.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there is more to depression </span><span class="s2">than lowered neurotransmitters. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Depression has also been linked to changes in brain structure. Patients have been found to have a smaller hippocampus, a brain region associated with mood, Canli said. There are also differences in neuroplasticity, or the ability of the brain to physically change its connections, in depressed patients.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">There are previous examples of infectious agents causing behavior changes, too. Canli cites Toxoplasmosis in his paper, a condition caused by a parasite that has been known to cause behavior changes in rats and possibly humans.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Furthermore, up to a third of the world is affected by it, without any visible symptoms, Canli said. The infectious disease hypothesis also explains the high rate of recurrence of depression.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">“Once you have one episode of depression, there’s a 50-percent chance you will have another, and if you do there is an 80-percent chance of a third,” Canli said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Such high rates of recurrence could be due to an infectious agent never leaving the body, instead going dormant and re-appearing later.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">There is a distinction between an infectious disease and a contagious disease. It would impossible to “catch” depression from a depressed patient. There is no increase in the rate of depression of mental health workers, and depression does not match the spreading patterns of a contagious disease, Canli said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Canli said he hopes to eventually perform a study on this subject. However, he admitted that “it’s hard to do science without funding.” Canli has to consult existing data available to him to find clues to this idea in order to create a proposal for this study. Eventually, he hopes to be able to dig through gathered patient data to try and find evidence of an infectious agent, and, if so, what type of agent it would be. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">“If you think about it in terms of ‘could it be some sort of infectious disease, some kind of infection’, then there are ways to systematically search for such infectious agents,” Canli said, adding, “and if you were to discover one or more than one, then you could study what they do and how they work, and then you get the actual mechanism.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

(PHOTO CREDIT: STONYBROOK.EDU)[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">LGBTQ advocates at Stony Brook are raising questions over a stipulation in the Food and Drug Administration’s recommendation to lift a lifetime ban on blood donations by gay and bisexual men.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The FDA’s recommendation to impose a 12-month ban on men who have had sex with another man has made some LGBTQ students upset because many still consider it an act of blatant discrimination.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Preventing men who [had] sex with men from donating if they’ve had sexual contact with their monogamous partners within a year is certainly not a policy that I am happy about,” Tyler Morrison, Stony Brook alumus and founder of the Blood Donor Equality Movement on campus, said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, Morrison stressed that the lift on the lifetime ban is a step in the right direction and “a reason for hope.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Morrison and three other Stony Brook University students, Michael Duffy, Jamie Leonard and Tobin George, formed the movement in spring of 2013. Their original goal was to raise national awareness on the FDA’s lifetime ban and, in turn, pressure the FDA and former Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, to revise the policy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The group held a blood equality panel in November 2013 at the Wang Center Theater.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The movement has been inactive as of this past semester but Morrison said he will offer guidance and “pass the torch” to any “socially conscious” students who are willing to take on the challenge for further policy change. The changes would either eliminate the 12-month ban or encourage the prevention on blood donations from people who practice unsafe sex regardless of their sexual orientation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">David Kilmnick, Ph.D, Stony Brook alum and CEO of Long Island GLBT Service Network, called for the elimination of the 12-month ban not only because of its discriminatory nature but also the lack of scientific support.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“All blood donations are tested regardless of gender, race or nationality because HIV doesn’t discriminate,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Kilmnick said. “It affects everyone. The policy is not based on science but of fear.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to Kilmnick, every donor goes through the same blood testing, so the 12-month ban not only discriminates but also reinforces the HIV stigma with gay men. The only way to identify a donor’s sexual preference and sexual history is through an interview process with a nurse as a part of the Donor Registration Questionnaire.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While a gay man who practiced safe sex can bypass the 12-month ban by posing as a heterosexual man in the Donor Registration Questionnaire, Kilmnick pointed out a social issue that has long plagued the gay community.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Anyone can lie or hide their gender but it’s not the right way because that would suggest people must stay in the closet in order to help others,” Kilmnick said. “Should we promote lies or openness against gender inequality?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To Kilmnick, discrimination is not acceptable even for an hour, a day, a week or a month. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">John Martin, assistant director of the LGBTA Services at the Center for Prevention and Outreach, shared a similar stance while he considered the lift of the lifetime ban a step of progress, he said it is not “far enough” because to ask a potential donor to wait 12 months to be eligible is simply “impossible.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>This story is part one of a series on Campus Dining meal plans.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While Stony Brook University’s Bronze meal plan seems like an economically favorable decision for resident students, a <i>Statesman </i>review of Campus Dining prices and policies has revealed the plan is leaving students’ wallets and stomachs empty.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As of the Spring 2014 semester, 6,422 students were enrolled in one of the four residential meal plans the university offers, according to the Faculty Student Association website. Of those, 3,238 students were enrolled in the least expensive option—the Bronze plan. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The bronze plan costs $1,930 per semester including the $605 operating expense. This operating expense “is used to pay for Campus Dining facility renovations and debt service on new construction,” according to the FSA website. It is money that students cannot spend.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After that operating fee has been deducted, students are left with $1,325 to budget throughout the semester, or approximately $11 to spend per day. In order for a student to have enough money to extend through the 17-week fall term, the plan averages 10 meals per week. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The bronze plan was never intended for people who are going to be here seven days a week,” Angela Agnello said. Agnello is the director of marketing and communications for the FSA, which runs Stony Brook’s Campus Dining Services.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, Stony Brook University’s Spring 2014 Campus Dining Survey, conducted by the university’s Center for Survey Research, found that 71 percent of resident undergraduates on a meal plan “spend every or most weekends on campus during the semester and of those 71% report buying food on Saturday and Sunday.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The same survey found that the Student Activities Center “is the most frequented dining facility for a plurality of undergraduates.” The cost of a turkey sandwich at the SAC is $6, and the cost of a 20-ounce bottle of water is $1.75. A student on the bronze plan who made those purchases would have </span>only $3.25 for the rest of the day.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Taylor Bouraad, a junior majoring in marine vertebrate biology, used Stony Brook’s silver meal plan option until she decided to upgrade to gold after running out of money<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>for four consecutive semesters. Bouraad said she tries to stay on campus most weekends throughout the semester.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The silver plan is less expensive than the gold, which costs $235 more for only two extra meals per week than the silver plan. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In comparison, the gold plan costs $353 more than the bronze plan for only three extra meals per week, while the silver plan costs $118 more than the bronze plan for only one extra meal per week. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bouraad said even though her estimated spending came to approximately $20 per day from eating multiple small meals and drinking a couple cups of coffee, money has become more manageable since transitioning to the gold plan. Yet, she feels certain issues still need to be addressed. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I feel that the more ‘healthy’ meal options on campus are more expensive,” Bouraad wrote in an email, “which leads to many students, including myself, to pay higher prices for lunch and dinners.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If a student does not live in a cooking building they must pay the price of their meal plan in addition to the price of their room—which in all cases, far exceeds $5,000.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Among the 28 residence halls on campus, only four are designated “cooking,” where residents are not mandated to have a meal plan. In addition, Stony Brook has prohibited the use of “hot plates, [or] any cooking appliance including, but not limited to: microwaves, grill cookers, coffee makers without automatic shut off, toaster ovens, etc.” in any of the campus dormitories, according the university’s website. If a student decides to purchase meals off campus, these mandates ensure their options are limited. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To help address students’ limited options, Stony Brook University opened the SBU Food Pantry on Sept. 18, 2013, becoming one of over 100 campuses across the United States that have joined the College and University Food Bank Alliance.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Since it opened in the fall 2013 semester, Casey McGloin, Stony Brook’s Food Pantry co-founder, said that the number of guests using the food pantry, mostly students, has increased from approximately 50 to 70 per week.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The pantry initially started because of anecdotal information heard by students, staff, and faculty about students and staff not being able to afford to eat three meals a day or only being able to afford unhealthy food,” McGloin said.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nuclear power has long been touted as one of the cleanest and greenest energy sources. Even so, the 2011 Fukushima meltdown demonstrated more could be done in the way of safety, including the ability to better predict the flow of melted reactor cores.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Now, thanks to research led by a Stony Brook professor, the structure of molten uranium dioxide, the chief component of nuclear fuel rods, has been discovered—and that is just for starters.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a study published in “Science,” Stony Brook’s John Parise and his colleagues used a special levitator to determine the atomic structure of uranium dioxide, or UO<sub>2</sub>, at extremely high temperatures—over 3000 Kelvin. They found that UO<sub>2</sub> undergoes oxygen disorder near its melting temperature of 3140 Kelvin, above which the average number of bonds to oxygen drops from eight to 6.7. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">“Materials scientists use models, such as in the design of aircraft wings, since you cannot just keep testing materials,” Parise said. “Previously these models had been really difficult to develop for UO</span><span class="s1"><sub>2</sub></span><span class="s3">, because no one had been able to melt and measure a sample.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Up until we did the experiment there had been several models predicting the properties of molten UO<sub>2</sub>,” he continued. “Our findings helped us distinguish between the different models. It basically set an experimental benchmark against which future models must fit.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To study the structure of molten uranium dioxide, Parise and his colleagues had to figure out how to achieve such high temperatures without melting their testing apparatus. To do this, the scientists aerodynamically levitated a sample of UO<sub>2</sub> in argon gas and heated the sample with a laser. They then used synchrotron x-ray diffraction to analyze its structure. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“When you shine x-rays at material, the waves interact with atoms and give rise to a diffraction </span>pattern,” Parise said. “That is, the beam deviates from the beam path and scatters in one particular direction or another. We measure that pattern to learn more about the structure of the atoms in the material.”</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“By analyzing the patterns and intensities produced by x-ray diffraction, you can draw inferences about which atoms are where,” Parise continued. “We used this in the context of molten </span><span class="s2">UO<sub>2</sub></span><span class="s1"> to test previous models that look at properties
like viscosity.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One of the most pressing applications for the structural data will be in modeling what occurs during the meltdown of a nuclear fission plant. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“While designing nuclear plants, engineers want to be able to predict how quickly the molten uranium will flow, for instance, during a meltdown,” Parise said. “Of course, in a meltdown it will not be pure molten </span><span class="s2">UO<sub>2</sub></span><span class="s1">, so this is a first step.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Parise and his colleagues plan to use a similar apparatus to test the structural properties of other molten compounds.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Our current work was done using argon gas,” Parise said. “However, many materials, like iron-containing compounds, exhibit different properties depending on the atmosphere. Our next step will be to look at compounds suspended in gases other than argon.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With nuclear fission becoming a widespread energy source in the developed world, structural data like this will contribute to safer and better-designed nuclear power plants. Nonetheless, the techniques used by Parise and his colleagues can be used to study a host of other compounds with properties still unknown due to their high melting points.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the meantime, Parise had a few words of advice for budding Stony Brook scientists and engineers. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“If you are interested in a topic try to find a mentor who can introduce you to their research or lab,” he said. “Even if you start with very basic experiments, so long as it is an area that interests and excites you. There’s nothing like excitement to really
spur you on.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

Streetlight Manifesto, a ska-punk band, will be performing at Stony Brook on <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_588263809"><span class="aQJ">Thursday, Jan. 29</span></span>.

This concert will be the third one this year as part of the Undergraduate Student Government’s Stony Brook Concert Series. There is nothing like some good music to help Seawolves get back into the swing of the semester after a long winter break.

The concert is going to be held at <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_588263810"><span class="aQJ">8 p.m.</span></span> in SAC Ballroom A. Students had the opportunity to reserve tickets starting on Sunday, Jan. 18.

Students need their Stony Brook ID to purchase tickets, which are on sale for $5.

Students can reserve a ticket through a Google order form.

The band’s latest album, “The Hands That Thieve,” was released in 2013 and received top ratings and reviews from iTunes, Alternative Press and PunkNews.org, to name a few.

Ska is a genre of music that involves elements from jazz, calypso and Caribbean, among other genres. The band members play instruments like the trumpet, saxophone and trombone.

The combination of these jazz instruments with the guitar, drums and playful melodies creates a fun atmosphere perfect for dancing.

The singer and one of the band’s guitarists, Tomas Kalnoky, is known for spewing his lyrics in a very fast pace to go along with the up-beat, enthusiastic music.

The band has its own unique sound that can be compared to the sound of ska-punk band Reel Big Fish, who rocked Stony Brook campus back in 2012 for the Back to the Brook concert.

Streetlight Manifesto formed in 2002 and originate from New Brunswick, N.J.. The band put out its first album, “Everything Goes Numb,” in 2003.

The band is a combination of two other ska-punk bands, Catch 22 and One Cool Guy.

Two out of the five albums that the band released are cover albums.The album “Keasbey Nights,” released in 2006, is a re-recorded album.

The original album was released in 1998 by Catch 22. However, band members Kalnoky, bassist John Ansley and horn player James Egan left the group shortly after the release of that album. They re-recorded the album with Streetlight—their new band.

The band’s album “99 Songs of Revolution,” released in 2010, consists of all cover songs from artists like Paul Simon, Bad Religion and Dead Milkmen, to name a few.

The other three albums—”Everything Goes Numb” (2003), “Somewhere in the Between” (2007) and “The Hands that Thieve” (2013) are original songs from the band.

The band was recently on its Once More Into The Fray Tour in 2014, where they hit cities like Chicago, New York, Montreal, Boston, Toronto, Silver Springs and Sayreville.

This was a mini-tour for the band. In 2013, the band announced that they would not dive into any full-time tours anymore.

At the time the band described its plan to tour less on <a href="http://absolutepunk.net/" target="_blank">absolutepunk.net</a> as “stepping away from the table before we get sick of our favorite meal.”

So, what can Stony Brook students expect from a Streetlight Manifesto performance?

First, wear comfortable clothing because there will be a lot of dancing and you are bound to get hot, especially since the show will be SAC Ballroom.

Second, if you are not a fan, do not expect to be able to understand anything that Kalnoky or any of the other band members will be saying.

Given the typically fast nature of all of the songs, Kalnoky has trained himself to spit those lyrics freakishly quickly.

Also, students should be ready to jump.

The band members themselves like to hop around and that enthusiasm is contagious, which should make for an interesting and entertaining concert.

<strong>By Drew Ciampa and Andrew Eichenholz</strong>

On a night in which both teams were unable to pull away with their respective leads, Stony Brook’s Sabre Proctor put on an impressive show by scoring what proved to be the game-winning basket against UMass-Lowell.

Stony Brook (10-9, 3-3 America East) needed all it could get from its top scorer Thursday night, as they narrowly escaped with a 64-60 road win.

In a game that could have easily been overlooked, UMass-Lowell (7-12, 1-6), revealed itself to be a difficult test as the River Hawks stuck with the Seawolves all game.

The game was a tight one throughout with 12 lead changes and the largest point differential at five points in favor of the Seawolves.

With a strong effort early on, Proctor scored the first nine points for Stony Brook. The win brings the Seawolves to .500 in conference play at 3-3.

Proctor finished the night dropping a game-high 22 points, which moved her into a tie for 13th place on the Stony Brook all-time scoring leaderboard with 1,072 points.

The performance also awarded Procter her 15th double-digit game on the season. Playing only 24 minutes, Proctor continues to show her efficiency on the court.

Brittany Snow fell one rebound short of a double-double, contributing 17 points and nine rebounds in the winning effort.

Also hitting double-digit point totals were Christa Scognamiglio and Kori Bayne-Walker, with 13 and 10 points, respectively.

Bayne-Walker led the game with eight assists.

For UMass-Lowell, it was Jasmine McCroy who led the way, scoring 14 points and grabbing seven rebounds while Kayla Gibbs put in a 13-point effort.

With UMass-Lowell leading at halftime by a score of 30-29, the Seawolves maintained their composure and kept playing their game.

Taking advantage of its strength down low, Stony Brook outrebounded UMass-Lowell 20-11 in the second half.

Eventually, the victory on the boards gave Stony Brook ample scoring chances and at the 6:02 mark, Bayne-Walker tied the game.

From that point forward Stony Brook would not look back as they took the lead on the next possession and held onto it until the final buzzer sounded.

On Sunday afternoon, the Stony Brook women’s basketball team was back in action against Binghamton. SBU was too strong on the boards for the Bearcats and came away with the win in an important America East matchup,  67-54.

When the first-half buzzer sounded, the Seawolves were dominating play. What stood out was that they had more than double the offensive rebounds compared to Binghamton’s total tally on the boards in the first half.

But, as Head Coach Caroline McCombs led her team back to the locker room, it was only a three-point ballgame.

“We had to work on finishing,” senior Sabre Proctor said. “That’s an Achilles heel that we need to kind of work on, is finishing on second possessions.”

Proctor worked on it herself in the second half, scoring 10 of her 14 points. Between crashing the boards for six rebounds and cashing in on all five of her free throw opportunities, it was a solid performance for the team’s leading scorer.

But, it was an overall team effort in earning more and more second chance opportunities throughout the game.

Four Seawolves registered six or more rebounds. Alyssa Coiro had one of her better performances during her time on Long Island.

After not being able to cash in on her early chances, Coiro turned it on in the second half netting eight points and eight rebounds in the game to help the team to its fourth America East victory of the season.

The Bearcats’ nine three-pointers kept what should have been an easy win close, turning things into a battle.

For McCombs, there were many positives.

“Our team was relentless on the glass,” the first-year Head Coach said. “[We] just never really let down despite a lot of three point shots.”

The Seawolves will start the second half of their conference slate after playing Hartford on Thursday, making every game important. From the No. 2 to the No. 5 in the conference, the teams are within only a couple of games of one another.

“You just have to prepare your team,” McCombs said. “Take it one game at a time.”

<i>With the semester starting up again comes the return of our weekly basketball column, “Points in the Paint,” in which four points of interest about Stony Brook hoops action are analyzed. This week we recap four things involving the SBU basketball teams that you may have missed over winter break.</i>

<b><i>Point #1: Stony Brook men’s basketball closed out 2014 with a bang with an upset win over No. 13 Washington</i></b>

In what could easily be considered the biggest win in program history, Stony Brook upstaged the then-No. 13 Washington Huskies in Seattle, 62-57, just before the calendar flipped to 2015.

The win came at the heels of a furious comeback led by the unlikeliest of heroes.

Kameron Mitchell, who had lost his spot in the starting lineup just ten days prior, buried four threes in the second half.

Carson Puriefoy only made one of his first 11 field goal attempts, but scored the game-tying three in crunch time.

Redshirt freshman Roland L’Amour Nyama came up with a huge steal to give the Seawolves a chance at taking the lead, which junior Jameel Warney seized.

SBU was down ten with 6:39 remaining when the comeback started, but the team’s defense was impeccable throughout the contest.

For the game, the Huskies were held to a measly 34.3 percent shooting clip despite coming into the contest with an undefeated record and far superior athleticism.

Warney finished with a team-high 15 points and Rayshaun McGrew added a double-double with 10 points and 14 rebounds.

Stony Brook’s win landed the mid-major team a feature on Sportscenter and proved that at their best, the Seawolves could beat just about any school in the country.

<b><i>Point #2: Stony Brook women’s basketball finds itself in middle of the pack after early conference action</i></b>

Last season, Seawolves fans returned from winter break to see that not the usual one, but two basketball teams were in strong contention for the America East crown.

After seasons of four wins and 14 wins, former women’s Head Coach Beth O’Boyle had her team right up there with Albany in the conference standings as students moved back into their dorms.

This season under new leadership and minus a couple of solid players, the Seawolves have a new battle to fight.

It is no longer about trying to earn the top seed for the tournament, but competing to find their identity in time to try to spring a surprise come tournament time.

Entering their game Sunday at Island Federal Credit Union Arena, Stony Brook was in fifth place in the America East conference, fighting to regain their status toward the top of the league.

Last season, it was about fighting to keep up with Albany and push past their nearest rival, New Hampshire. This year, it seems as if those two teams are in a league of their own.

As always, the team is not one-dimensional offensively, but something will need to start clicking.

Last season, six games into conference play, the Seawolves had scored over 80 points twice. This go-around, their high is 67 points.

<b><i>Point #3: Role players have been exuding confidence for SBU’s men’s team</i></b>

Coming into the season, there was plenty reason to expect Warney and Puriefoy to lead the show for Stony Brook while the rest of the squad merely tried to fit in.

The Seawolves are one of the most inexperienced teams in the country, being one of the 30 youngest teams in the nation and with five rotation players being freshmen.

Yet, as non-conference play reached its final stages and conference play began, it has been Stony Brook’s role players that have impressed most with their consistency, effort and composure.

McGrew, who emerged late last season as a rotation player, has been as perfect a third wheel as could be expected from Head Coach Steve Pikiell.

McGrew has scored in double-digits in six of Stony Brook’s last eight games and is averaging a modest 9.5 points and 7.7 rebounds on 47.1 percent shooting.

His baseline jumper is near automatic, he has been a way better high-low distributor than expected and he is calm and collected in everything he does on the court.

Playing under control was an issue for Nyama early on, but no longer is.

Nyama has mastered using his energy and athleticism without being overzealous, and it has produced tremendous results.

Nyama has been everywhere defensively and is connecting on 36.4 percent of his three-point tries, which is invaluable to this team.

His rebounding has slumped down a bit, but SBU needed him to crash the boards more against bigger non-conference opponents.

Nyama’s play could be pivotal come the postseason.

The bench unit has also been commendable, with Bryan Sekunda continually shooting with confidence, Tyrell Sturdivant dominating inside and Thrower showing promising glimpses.

Mitchell has perhaps seen the biggest improvement, with a fresh aura of confidence in his game ever since his huge night in Washington.

A month ago, Mitchell was not ball-faking his way to the rim or playing sound defense, but plenty has changed for these Seawolves as they have advanced into conference play.

<b><i>Point #4: SBU women’s basketball showed plenty of fight in its recent matchup against rival Albany</i></b>

In nearly every sport, the biggest obstacle for the Seawolves is their in-state rival, Albany.

Last year, that competition flared up during the women’s basketball season, as the dominant Great Danes faced a stiff test in conference for the first time in a long time.

Surprise, surprise. The problem was coming out of Long Island.

Stony Brook ended Albany’s 38-game winning streak in the America East at the end of the regular season before falling in the conference championship game.

This season with the Seawolves not as sharp early on in the season, it was unclear how tough they could hang with the Great Danes.

When they were down 20 points late in the game, it looked as if they had a while to go before they could challenge the best team in the league again.

However, they fought, and with the help of the three-point ball, got to within seven points in the waning minutes.

This occurred despite Sabre Proctor not connecting on a field goal in 29 minutes and committing seven turnovers.

Sophomore Christa Scognamiglio led the team with 19 points and senior Jessica Ogunnorin chimed in with 16.

It ended up not being enough, but it showed that even against the best, the Seawolves are willing to put up a fight.]]></content:encoded>

Pens and pins were the accessory of choice for stars like Helen Mirren, George Clooney and Sunrise Coigney at the 72nd Golden Globes Awards on Sunday, Jan. 11.

The stars represented free speech and honored the victims of the Jan. 7 Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks in Paris. Both actresses and actors commemorated those killed in the attacks in France.

Mirren, 69, wore her pen as a pin on the Beverly Hilton Hotel’s red carpet in Los Angeles. Mirren, nominated for her role in "The Hundred-Foot Journey," explained with a bright smile her reasoning behind her “pen-pin” on her red long-sleeved ensemble. She emphasized the importance of free speech and honored those killed.

Presenter Jared Leto introduced the sure-to-be trendy “man braid” to the world, as well as recognizing the symbolic “Je Suis Charlie” cause.

Coigney, 42, rose her pen in the air proudly alongside her husband Mark Ruffalo, 47, after a red carpet interview. Ruffalo was nominated for best supporting actor in his work in "The Foxcatcher." However, the award went to J.K. Simmons for his work in "Whiplash."

Clooney wore a black pin with white writing reading “Je Suis Charlie,” a slogan first used on Twitter meaning “I am Charlie” in French.

Stars such as Joshua Jackson and Diane Kruger also posed on the red carpet with signs that were printed with the "Je Suis Charlie" slogan.

Clooney honored the victims of the Charlie Hebdo shooting by sporting the pin during his speech after he was awarded the  Cecil B. DeMille award for Lifetime Achievement. Clooney said “A million people who marched, not just in Paris but all over the world.”

Clooney's wife Amal Alamuddin also showed her support on the red carpet with a pin on her white clutch bag.

Viewers around the world tuned into the 72nd Golden Globe Awards on NBC.

Last year, nearly 21 million people viewed the awards. According to Variety.com, ratings for the show were down compared to the year before.

This year was expected to have an even larger greater viewership given that it was Amy Poehler and Tina Fey’s final year presenting the Globes.

The stars used the opportunity to spread  awareness of free speech on a huge scale and to honor the 17 victims in Paris.]]></content:encoded>

After the Jan. 16 NYC Gotham Cup and Friday’s Metro Team Challenge, Stony Brook Track and Field had one member qualify for the ECACs in Christina Melian and another qualify for IC4As in Chris Hand.

Melian placed second overall and first among collegiate runners in the NYC Gotham Cup 3,000 meter run, posting a personal best time of 9:30.50, while Hand was third in the weight throw, recording a distance of 17.73 meters.

Elizabeth Caldwell and Tara Peck placed sixth and seventh, respectively, in the 3,000-meter race, with times of 10:02.56 and 10:16.06.

Kaylyn Gordon took eighth in long jump, leaping 5.60 meters.

Alex Lopresti, Bradley Amazan, Thomas Wimmers and Michael Watts ran a 10:19.78 in the men’s distance relay medley, which was good for a first place finish.

However, the group fell narrowly short of the IC4A qualifying time of 10:19.00.

At the Metro Team Challenge, held this past Friday at The Armory Track &amp; Field Center, the women’s distance medley relay, consisting of Tiana Guevara, Jane Clark, Kate Pouder and Olivia Ritchie, met the same fate as the men’s group’s time of 12:08.80 just missed the women’s ECACs qualifying time of 12:08.64.

Overall, the women took with 22 points and the men fell into 11th with 24.5.

Gordon had a great showing, placing first in her 60-meter dash heart, seventh overall in her preliminary round, and eighth in the finals with a time of 7.97 seconds.

She also placed third in the triple jump at 11.46 meters.

Courtney Warden also finished first in the 60-meter hurdle heat and ultimately took eighth with a time of 9.06 seconds.

Pouder placed seventh in the mile, 5:08.36, while her relay teammate Guevara took seventh in the 3,000-meter, 10:28.67.

Lopresti was a mere .23 seconds from IC4A 1,000 meter qualifier with his 2:28.73 third- place finish.

Wimmers placed seventh in the same race with a 2:34.66 run time.

The Seawolves will head over to Boston University for the John Thomas Terrier Classic from Jan. 30-31 for their next meet.

On Feb. 5, Stony Brook will be back in New York when they Seawolves take part in the Metropolitan Championships at The Armory Track &amp; Field Center.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA["The life of a seawolf is anything but easy"  That quote set the stage for exactly what i expected to see in this article, a horribly toxic look at SBU.  I hope that this is just a character and that nobody seems to hate almost every part of this day.  From the brutality of watching obscene amounts of netflix, to deliberately choosing some of the most expensive foods and then being upset about it.  And wow gross roommates what a uniquely difficult experience, its not like people have been dealing with that since before you were born.  If someone had this kind of sad outlook and constant glass half empty look on life I would say take a moment and evaluate what you are doing.  If you feel the need to talk down on your peers while you browse instagram or your poetry class is unbearable or having roomates is just too rough maybe going away to college is just not for you. 
 I'm sorry for my potentially rude rant but quite frequently I hear people bashing Stony Brook for being a terrible place.  It is a rarity to hear someone say how blessed they are to be able to attend college, to have 5 dining hall options to choose from, to have 300+ clubs and groups to get involved in, like the author is with the Statesman.  If this is you please stop for a moment and just think about all of the wonderful things being here has done for you, it shouldn't be hard once you get started!  Hopefully people can bring a more positive outlook and atmosphere to Stony Brook campus.]]></wp:comment_content>

While the Stony Brook men’s and women’s basketball teams have had some ups and downs in their 2014-2015 campaigns, the Seawolves on the ice have maintained a high level of play throughout their entire season.

Stony Brook hockey has stormed out to a 20-4 start on their season heading into their Arizona swing. The Seawolves played the defending American Collegiate Hockey Association champion Arizona State Sun Devils on Thursday night.

They then finished the trip with a doubleheader against the University of Arizona Wildcats on Friday and Saturday night.

While Stony Brook has been able to stay dominant, pulling a No. 7 ranking coming into this week, the team will be losing a key part of their team come February.

Senior Sam Brewster was nominated to the U.S. Men’s National University Team roster for the World University Games.

Brewster was one of 22 players selected to the event scheduled for Feb. 4-14 in Granada, Spain.

The senior from Plano, Texas is fourth on the team in points  (25) and is one of only five players on the roster to have played in all 24 games so far this season, heading into the week’s trip to the southwest.

Brewster is third on the team in both goals (11) and assists (14).

He also sits with the third most penalty minutes on the team with 43.

One fascinating aspect of the team that has been top-10 in the rankings all season long is its balance.

A Stony Brook player does not arrive on the scoring leaders list until the 33rd slot, where Ryan Cotcamp sits. However, the scoring has come from a lot of places.

Eight Seawolves’ skaters have 20 points or more on the season, and all but eight skaters have recorded a point on the season.

Six of those held pointless this season have played in four games or fewer.

The Seawolves have won three in a row since losing their first game after the Christmas break.

They were able to earn a split in a pair of home contests against Liberty.

After an ugly 7-3 loss on Jan. 10, the Seawolves were able to come back the next day and earn a hard-fought 3-2 victory.

Tyler Underhill scored with two seconds remaining to give the Seawolves the victory in a game in which neither team could get more than a one-goal advantage.

Stony Brook carried this momentum into the next weekend at The Rinx, sweeping the Delaware Blue Hens in a display of offensive dominance, winning 5-2 and 5-1 in the weekend doubleheader.

Brewster had two points in each matchup, dishing two assists in the Saturday matchup and then following it up by netting two goals on Sunday.

After the Seawolves finish in Arizona, they will face one last road test on their regular season schedule, and it is against a formidable opponent.

Stony Brook will head across the Long Island Sound and take on the University of Rhode Island at Bradford R. Boss Ice Arena Jan. 30-31.

That series could very well decide the Eastern States Collegiate Hockey League regular season title.

Stony Brook will then host a pair of series against Rutgers and Lebanon Valley in the first two weekends of February to round out the regular season slate.

The Scarlet Knights will then host the ESCHL tournament to decide who represents the league in the ACHA National Tournament. With every game now pivotal, Stony Brook will have to continue its strong play to reach its goal of winning a national championship.]]></content:encoded>

(MANJU SHIVACHARAN / THE STATESMAN)[/caption]

When women's lacrosse Head Coach Joe Spallina left his share of Division II National Championships at Adelphi to join the Stony Brook Seawolves, he set lofty goals. Two America East Conference titles and two second round NCAA appearances later, and the team is well on its way.

For one thing, the Seawolves are unanimously favored to win the America East Conference title for the third year in a row. The preseason poll is voted on by all of the head coaches in the conference, and the six other polls ranked Stony Brook at the top.

It is not the first time that the team has shared the honor, however, as they owned the top spot in the preseason poll before the last two seasons as well.

Last season in America East play, the Seawolves only lost one game–their last, against Vermont, 8-7 in overtime. It did not cost Stony Brook in the seeding department, however, as the Seawolves maintained their spot at No. 1 for the conference tournament. They proved that it was rightfully theirs, eventually beating Albany 7-1 to earn their NCAA Tournament bid.

This season, the team maintains its preseason spot atop the rankings despite losing Tewaraaton Award Nominee Frankie Caridi, who led the NCAA in both save percentage and goals against average in 2013 and 2014. She was also honored as a third-team All American last season.

On the offensive side, Spallina brings back a large majority of his scoring, as much of the Seawolves' offense came from freshmen last season. But, it will be supplemented by a strong recruiting class led by an offensive juggernaut in freshman Kylie Ohlmiller.

The season begins on Feb. 20 at Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium against USC. The matchup starts at 6 p.m..]]></content:encoded>

Religion is something that was created by mankind to do three things: keep people sane, make them easier to govern and give them a reason to unite as one people. At its core, whether you wish to believe it or not, almost every religion seems to preach the same kind of messages. They tell us to be good, do good and love everything and everyone. In spite of the peaceful bases upon which all religions have been founded, when you look back at the history of the human race, you cannot help but think of the terrible violence that has ensued as a byproduct of religion. From the Crusades to the Holocaust to the recent attack on the Charlie Hedbo offices, religious wars continue to this day.

I am sure I am not alone when I ask, if we are such an advanced and developed species, then why can’t we get past all of our differences?

It is during your adolescent that you first realize that the world is not all peaches and roses. You realize that all men are not treated equally as well as the fact that all people are not even seen equally. You come to understand that people classify themselves as belonging to a certain faith and celebrate their own holidays and practice their own customs entirely different from your own. As you grow, whether it be your religious leader, a parent or an older sibling, someone will shape the way you view people of other faiths. You will be told to stay away from certain types of people, or to refuse to accept an invitation to the house of a follower of a certain religion. All these sanctions will be placed on your behavior for what reason? Because you believe in a different god? The simple answer is yes.

This past month, I went to see an Indian film called "PK" with my parents (what else is a nineteen-year-old to do on a Wednesday night?) It stars Bollywood-legend Aamir Khan as an alien-astronaut, PK, stranded on Earth. PK struggles to find a way to contact his people to take him back home. During his journey on Earth, PK asks the Earthlings he encounters where he could find the stolen device that would call his spaceship back. Almost all of them told him something along the lines of, “Only God knows.” Naturally, not knowing who or what this God character was, PK sets out on a quest to find him. PK soon realizes that there is not just one entity or person that these people were referring to. He then came to the understanding that different people believed in different Gods because of their varying religions. PK struggled so mightily to grasp this idea that he came up with on his own. He surmised that there are two types of god; the one that we created and the one that created us, and it is the one that created us that matters most.

It does not matter if you are Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, atheist or agnostic. The aforementioned message is essentially universal. It stresses human unity and at the same time eliminates the impetus on religious belief. Whether you believe humans were directly or indirectly created by the work of a higher being or not, you can agree that each and every human being is made of the same basic elements. Therefore, the next time you see someone wearing a cross, a hijab, a turban, a bindi or a yamaka, try not to think about their or your religious predispositions. Instead, think about what unites you in a more special way than any faith can: humanity.]]></content:encoded>

Here we are, yet another year upon us, and despite the numerous Instagram photos captioned with inspirational quotes and motivational promises for a rebirth of the soul and Twitter posts hashtagged #NewYearNewMe, it is safe to assume that all that potential for 2015 has gone down the drain at this point.

I know that more than half of my readers are probably sheepishly grinning to themselves, knowing that even Kim Kardashian’s short-lived marriage of 72 days lasted longer than their even-shorter-lived new year’s resolutions, but it is okay. Admitting it is the first step.

Now that we have chastised ourselves for yet another year of made-and-forgotten New Year’s plans, it is time to stop wallowing and start wondering what we will do from this point forward. The tendency to disregard yearly resolutions and revert to old habits could be due to the overwhelming nature of a project that seems to take a whole 365 days to complete. Most of us cannot even solidify a plan for the weekend, much less account for every single day to come for the rest of the year. Alternatively, breaking down these prodigious resolutions into more manageable weekly goals, may prove to be a more effective means of accomplishing what we originally intended when we made our new year’s resolutions in the first place. Here are the top 10 New Year’s resolutions that we make and break every year, along with a strategy to overcoming it. Good luck everyone and Happy New Year!

<strong> </strong>
<ol start="10">
	<li><strong> Catch more Z’s.</strong></li>
</ol>
So it is 8 p.m., we sit down to start homework and by the time we watch Netflix, surf Facebook, guffaw at foul YikYak and tweet about how much of a boss we are at procrastinating, it is midnight and nothing has been accomplished. So you proceed to stay up way into the wee hours of the morning banging out a paper due early the next day, rush to class to hand it in and then, you are knocked out with your forehead hitting your binder rings on the desk in front of you from lack of sleep. So instead of declaring that this year you will get more sleep or procrastinate less, hence making time for more sleep, I would say set a deadline. Set a cut off time for every night. Despite what’s going on in a day, vow to sleep at 12 a.m. every night and wake up at 7:30 a.m. every morning. This will not only regulate your sleep and help you develop a normal sleep/wake pattern; it will also program you to accomplish all that you have on your daily to-do list within the parameters of time set for yourself during the day, as well as keep you from sacrificing some much-needed shut-eye.

<strong> </strong>
<ol start="9">
	<li><strong> 4.0 here I come….again…but not really.</strong></li>
</ol>
It is the start of a new year, and subsequently, a new semester, and we all swear this one will be better than the last. We will do all of our homework, hand everything in on time, and study 40 hours a week just like our professors suggested so we can be an ace in all 19 credits we are taking and not have to worry about sinking GPAs and not getting into graduate school. However, after day one of the semester, we are in a state of paralysis after hearing and witnessing the horror that is BIO 203. Breathe. Rather than obsessing over a number, figure out what is needed to achieve academic success on a daily basis. After all, your education should not be crammed into one night of studying for an exam, but should take place gradually over the course of the entire semester. So read your syllabi, utilize your weekly (yes, weekly) planner, and manage your study schedule by setting realistic chunks of work into your schedule and knocking them off your list as the day goes by. You will retain so much more overtime, and the outcome in the end will be a well-deserved A. Trust me. Never forget to lean on your peers for support and set aside time every week at least once, to attend office hours or tutoring if you are in need of a little extra clarification. Bonus: make it a social thing! Form study sessions and peer groups with your buddies to help one another out as well as spend time together.

<strong> </strong>
<ol start="8">
	<li><strong> Go green, save green.</strong></li>
</ol>
As college students, we have all had that experience of swiping our meal card midway through the semester and seeing that we are way below the dollar mark for our designated meal plan. In an effort to save money this year, try assessing what you spend the most money on in a week and working out alternatives to replace or supplement these cravings. For example, for all you caffeine addicts who need to get your fix more than twice a day, treat yourself to a Starbucks the first time and then settle for the cheaper brand at the SAC or in the Union Deli for the other times (let's be honest; you really don’t need to drink four Caramel Brulees in one day; not to mention sugar coma!) Even better, walk with your own coffee mug and have it refilled at a lower cost by most coffee retailers on campus. You will be doing your part to save the planet and cutting back on the green leaving your wallet.

<strong> </strong>
<ol start="7">
	<li><strong> Be a Seawolf, not just a Stony Brooker.</strong></li>
</ol>
With social media constantly consuming our every moment, it is easy to conclude that everyone is more involved on campus than you are. Annoying is the do-gooder who attends every charity event and is constantly changing their Facebook profile picture to that of the next campus activity that they are promoting. Like seriously stop. No, not the philanthropic promoter; they should not stop. You, the Facebook stalker should stop! Stop hating and get out there and get involved. There are so many activities of all kinds happening on campus every single day. Heed the Facebook group posts and the event pages and try to make it a priority to attend one or two of these events a month. It gives you an opportunity to socialize, get involved, and meet a ton of new people. Where is the "lame" in that?

<strong> </strong>
<ol start="6">
	<li><strong> Network, network, network!</strong></li>
</ol>
In this day and age, the importance of networking and making connections could not be stressed enough. It often feels like in a sea of people, all of whom are overqualified, overachieving and overactive (see above), it matters more who you know rather than what you know. But the million dollar question still remains: "How do I make the right connections, meet the right people and align myself for the right reasons?" Although I do not have a definitive answer to this, your best bet is to start somewhere. Attend events, talk to your professors and inquire among your peers and friends if you know they are affiliated with people or organizations in which you have an interest. Do not be afraid to reach out and form a bond because you never know who has what to offer. Similarly, you would be surprised what assets you may have that other people find interesting or desirable. It is just a matter of getting yourself out there and maintaining contact with those around you.

<strong> </strong>
<ol start="5">
	<li><strong> I am over it. Well not really, not yet, but soon.</strong></li>
</ol>
I will not talk to him, I will not talk to her, I am leaving them in the past…until they are in front of your face and you suddenly, can not resist the urge to talk to them. And you do. And it is the same old cycle that it has always been. Getting over an ex and learning to let go is one of the most arduous tasks in a person’s life. It consumes so much time and effort just thinking about ways to avoid your once-significant other. Half the time, you realize that it is not all that successful because even if you are not physically with that person, you are still obsessively thinking about them all the time. Hit pause. Instead of swearing off this person, which, to be honest, is next to impossible with their face popping up in your news feed even if they are defriended (thanks People You May Know) or running into them in North Reading Room because yes, they too want a 4.0, accept that their existence is inevitable and there is no changing that. Instead, embrace it. Smile when you see them, but do not go out of your way to consciously contact them. Throw yourself into other activities and other goals, and consume your days with you time that you never had before when you were tied down. Create a routine that does not involve or rely on other people so that you can break old habits of seeing this person and stick to it. Talk to your friends about how you feel, lean on your family and do things that remind you of how great you are. Really, you are so much better than last year’s drama.

<strong> </strong>
<ol start="4">
	<li><strong> Ugh parents, so annoying.</strong></li>
</ol>
As many of us move back on campus after a long two months of being home under the watchful eyes of our parents, we let out a sigh of relief. No more rules, no more curfew and sadly, no more home-cooked meals, either. Yet still, even in the distance, a lot of us can still find time to bristle at every word of advice and wisdom our parents try to bestow on us, which, if we really think about it, is for our own benefit. Few of us can admit this, yet we secretly sulk over the fact that we just can not seem to get along with mom and dad. It is a tough one but definitely doable: the old “argue less with my parents” resolution. Make it a point to not raise your voice. Keep calm in the face of confrontation and assert the adult that you are becoming. After all, it is not very adult at all to hang up phones or storm off and slam bedroom doors in your parents’ faces; so high school. Instead, if you need a moment, articulate that, do not suppress and harbor animosity towards your parents, just learn to control and express it in a more mature manner. You will definitely be on your way to a healthier relationship with your 'rents for sure.

<strong> </strong>
<ol start="3">
	<li><strong> Farewell to foul language.</strong></li>
</ol>
"I really need to stop cursing," says everyone at some point in the midst of their foul-mouthed rant. Although curses do help to punctuate our point at times, it is really a habit that should be kept at bay, if not cut out completely from our daily discourse. Instead of swearing off curse words all together (pun intended), banning one or two specific words from your vocabulary that you find particularly perverse, or limiting the people who you allow to hear your French, may prove effective in helping you cut back on this dirty habit.

<strong> </strong>
<ol start="2">
	<li><strong> Here we go, greens again.</strong></li>
</ol>
At this point, we may have already surpassed the age for, succumbed to, or fought against the dreaded “Freshman 15.” However, the uphill battle to consume more greens and just eat healthier in general is one that we swear we will stick to every year, yet find ourselves discarding as we binge eat chocolate chip cookies and Doritos during our late-night study sessions for Exam 1 of the semester. Rather than parting with our comfort food, we should try to make it a point to eat at least one meal of the day cleanly. That is, more veggies, less carbs and lots and lots of water. Carry protein bars and healthy snacks with you so you can reach for them when you feel like nibbling on something as the day goes, and you will be less likely to run to the front aisle of the SAC for a quick-fix. Make one day of the week a cheat day of sorts where you can have your favorite guilty pleasure, but stick to your green-diet for the rest of the week so you do not have to feel bad about it. Also, try juicing. It is a great, quick way to pack protein, fruits and vegetables into your diet and can be an extremely filling, not to mention yummy, addition to your day.

<strong> </strong>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Ta-ta ten pounds!</strong></li>
</ol>
The most sworn on resolution every single year; "I must, I must, I must decrease my waist line," says everyone every year, for a year, sitting on the couch, watching television…you get the point. It is seriously time to stop turning your treadmill into a clothes rack, dust off your cobwebbed weights and get your body back in shape. Hit the gym. It does not get more plain than that. Make it a date with your best friend and include dinner together afterwards so you can spend time together and motivate each other to go. Take advantage of the Rec Center, or other campus gyms, which you pay for with tuition (so do not waste that money being a couch potato). You will seriously regret it when you have to splurge on gym memberships after graduation.

Margaret Cho’s “All American Girl,” a sitcom centered on a Korean-American family, made its season run in 1994.

Since then, Asian-American families seemed to disappear from the small screen. Now, the four will burst back onto the scene with Food personality Eddie Huang’s “Fresh off the Boat,” which premieres on ABC this Wednesday, Feb. 4.

Our campus’ Asian-American students should rejoice, as this will be the first show about Asian-American’s life in the US in nearly 21-years.

The show, loosely based on Huang’s memoir of the same name, features a Taiwanese-American family in the 90s that moved from the inner city of Washington D.C. to the suburbs of Orlando.

The show centers on a young Eddie, played by Hudson Yang, as he adjust to the middle-class suburb lifestyle and all the growing pains along the way.

The show supports Hudson, an 11-year-old and unproven actor, with a somewhat well-known Asian-American cast.

Seasoned actor Randall Park plays Eddie’s father, Louis. Park is known for his hilarious portrayal as Margarita-drinking, Katy Perry-loving North Korean Dictator Kim Jong Un in “The Interview.” Constance Wu, a TV and film actor, plays Eddie’s mother Jessica.

Eddie also has two younger brothers, Evan, played by Ian Chen and Emery, played by Forrest Wheeler.

Lucille Soong, of “The Joy Luck Club” fame, plays Grandma Huang, yes, first name grandma, per Chinese tradition.

The show will follow the style of “Everybody Hates Chris,” mixed with a bit of “Modern Family’s” single camera, multi-set scheme.

Huang, the shows creator, is a revelation of sorts in the Asian-American community.

A Taiwanese-American who grew up in a middle class family in Orlando, Huang worked as a lawyer before opening BaoHaus, a East Village eatery known for its Baos­­­ —Chinese sandwiches—at the height of NYC’s Bao craze.

He was featured on an episode of Vice’s restaurateur show “Munchies.” Huang’s outgoing, hip-hop infused personality won over the young audience and he eventually went on to host his own cooking  show, “Fresh off the Boat” later changed to "Huang’s World" on Vice’s subsidiary site, Munchies. Huang has defied Asian stereotypes every step of the way as he gains popularity in the public.

“Fresh off the Boat” will have a two-episode premiere during ABC’s Comedy Block, with the “Pilot” episode airing at 8:30p.m. and then “The Shunning” at 9:30 p.m. The show will settle into its regular time slot on Tuesdays at 8 p.m.

Let us hope “Fresh off the Boat,” like its creator, will be funny and entertaining while aiming to break some stereotypical perceptions of the Asian-American community.]]></content:encoded>

The Stony Brook track and field team traveled up to Boston University on Friday and Saturday to participate in the John Thome Terrier Classic, and once again it was Christina Melian stealing the spotlight.

Melian participated in the 5,000-meter run and won the race with a time of 16:00.14. The junior’s run is currently ranked among the top 10 times in the country. The runners with the top 16 times on March 7 will advance to the NCAA Championships.

Another strong performer for the women’s team on Friday was sophomore distance runner Elizabeth Caldwell. She competed in the 5,000-meter run indoors for the first time and posted an ECAC-qualifying time of 17:18.31.

Freshman Jane Clark also had a strong day. She finished seventh in the 1,000-meters race and her time of 2:52.06 qualified her for the ECAC Championship meet. On the second day of the John Thome Terrier Classic, it was the Stony Brook men’s team’s turn to compete.

Unfortunately for Head Coach Andy Ronan, there were not as many standouts on day two.

Junior Bradley Amazan was able to place 15th in the 1,000-meter race. His time of 2:28.39 qualified for IC4As.

Freshman Michael Watts also met the IC4A standard on Saturday, thanks to a time of 8:24.00 in the 3,000-meter race. He finished in 34th place in the race.

Seawolves just falling short of reaching IC4A qualifying times included senior sprinter Lamar Hayes and junior distance runner Mitchell Kun.

Hayes posted a time of 22.28 in the 200-meter dash, which finished him 39th. He also finished fourth in the long jump with a quality jump of 6.89 meters.

Kun ran well in the 5000 meters, placing 24th with a time of 14:44.26, falling just short of the 14:42.50 qualifying mark.

Stony Brook will return to action this Thursday when the team competes in the Metropolitan Championships at The Armory Track &amp; Field in New York City. On Friday, the teams will head to compete in the Giegengack Invitational, which is held in New Haven, Conn.

The following weekend, the Seawolves will be looking to break the hearts of the other competitors in the David Hemery Valentine Invitational in Boston, Mass.

This is the team’s final meet before the America East Championships on Feb. 20-21 in New York, N.Y.]]></content:encoded>

After winning the regular season championship, the Stony Brook softball team was picked to top the standings in the America East preseason poll. The Seawolves received five of the seven first-place votes and 34 points in total.

The Albany Great Danes were a close second with the other two first-place votes. The Head Coaches of each team in the conference all vote for the top-seeded team in preseason polls. Coaches are not allowed to vote for their own team.

The Seawolves are coming off a fantastic 34-18 (15-2 in conference) season, winning 30 of their final 38 games.

The team’s ace, two-time America East Pitcher of the Year Allison Cukrov, returns to Stony Brook after winning 23 games and posting up a 2.10 ERA.

Second-team all-conference outfielders Shayla Giosa and Bria Green are also returning to the team after hitting a combined .310 average with 43 extra-base hits and 85 RBIs.

The softball team has placed progressively higher in the preseason poll over the past few years, placing in third in 2013, and then moving up one spot to second in 2014. Their season will begin in Florida as the Seawolves take on Oakland in the Florida Gulf Coast Tournament on Feb. 20.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>By David Vertsberger and Andrew Eichenholz</strong>

[caption id="attachment_34655" align="alignleft" width="600"]<a href="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Andrew-Eichenholz-MBB-vs-HART-70-of-287.jpg"><img class="wp-image-34655 size-medium" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Andrew-Eichenholz-MBB-vs-HART-70-of-287-600x400.jpg" alt="ANDREW EICHENHOLZ / THE STATESMAN" width="600" height="400" /></a> Jameel Warney (above, No. 20) lays up a shot.  Warney averages 15.5 points on 53 percent shooting per night.  <em>ANDREW EICHENHOLZ / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

<em><strong>Point #1: Jameel Warney is being tested defensively</strong></em>

Opposing teams know the first player they need to scheme against when Stony Brook appears on their schedule is the 2013-14 America East Player of the Year Jameel Warney. With averages of 15.5 points, 11.1 rebounds, 2.3 and 2.5 blocks a night on 53 percent shooting, he without a doubt commands the attention of competitors on a nightly basis.

However, teams have begun learning how to hinder Warney’s presence on the Seawolves by attacking him, not trying to stop him. Warney is a very smart defender who uses verticality properly and knows Head Coach Steve Pikiell’s system to the minute detail, but he does have his weaknesses on that end. Quicker big men that can shoot from outside have been his kryptonite this season.

Warney has lagged behind on rotations when opposing bigs possessed extended range, as was the case against New Hampshire’s Tanner Leissner, who scored 19 points with three threes against the Seawolves. There are ways around this, such as if Pikiell had the Seawolves switch on pick-and-pops, but come the postseason, Stony Brook will need an answer.

<em><strong>Point #2: Time is running out for the SBU women’s basketball team</strong></em>

For a team that won 24 games last season, 20 more than just two seasons before that, a 4-4 start in America East play is quite underwhelming. Senior Sabre Proctor and much of the team’s core from last year is still on the team.

One could argue that there is still time to turn things around, but that grace period is disappearing, and doing so quickly. Head Coach Caroline McCombs and company have now seen each and every team in the conference at least once, so there is no longer room for error.

The team has important contests not only for better placement seeding wise in the America East Tournament, but for the Seawolves’ own confidence heading into the biggest showdown of the season, bar none. There is no more time to wait, the best of the team needs to rear its head, and fast.

<em><strong>Point #3: Can Deshaun Thrower be the spark SBU needs?</strong> </em>

Last season, Stony Brook had the luxury of being able to bring Anthony Jackson or Carson Puriefoy off the bench to provide an offensive spark. This year, SBU lacks that luxury.

Although players like Tyrell Sturdivant, Kameron Mitchell and Bryan Sekunda have been solid, none of them are major scoring threats.

However, one reserve that shown signs of becoming Stony Brook’s new instant offense guy: freshman Deshaun Thrower. Thrower is shooting under 30 percent from both the field and downtown, but in his past six games has connected on 45.8 percent of his field goals and has made a three in each of those contests.

He seems to be stepping up with Puriefoy struggling, even starting against UMass-Lowell a little over a week ago. Recently, Pikiell has actually played him alongside Puriefoy in some lineups. Thrower’s handling ability is superb and his strength at the one position makes him a wrecking ball when he attacks the basket aggressively. His jumper is flat, but deadly at times.

He has all the tools to be a very good point guard in a year or two, but as unfair as it sounds, Stony Brook might need that development to happen sooner rather then later.

<em><strong>Point #4: Rebounding is a strength for women’s team, and it has to be.</strong></em>

Without a shadow of a doubt, the identity of the Stony Brook Seawolves is playing tough down low. A lot of the team’s scoring comes from its forwards, and opportunities are created when its guards drive the lane to open up shots on the wing.

But, perhaps the most important aspect of that is the team’s rebounding. The Seawolves are a close second in the America East team rebounding race, routing opponents in that department a large majority of the time.

In their loss at home against Hartford on Thursday night, the Seawolves only won the battle by a single board, which ended up not being enough. This team needs to show that it is that much more physical and willing to play harder than their opponents to win.

It is safe to say going down the stretch that if they should start losing the rebounding battle, it will be difficult to string together wins and make a tournament run.]]></content:encoded>

Led by junior midfielder Challen Rogers, who was named an Inside Lacrosse preseason All-American Honorable Mention, Stony Brook men’s lacrosse was ranked second in the America East preseason poll. The poll is voted on by the league’s coaches, and the Seawolves were ranked behind the Albany Great Danes, last year’s America East champions.

The selection of Albany atop the conference is a consensus pick amongst lacrosse outlets. The Great Danes are led by the one of the best players in the country in Lyle Thompson, who was selected first in the recent Major League Lacrosse Draft. The dynamic attackman also shared last season’s Tewaraaton Award with brother Miles Thompson while also saving Albany’s season with mere seconds on the clock, as the Seawolves came that close to defeating the Great Danes in the America East semifinals.

Junior attackman Brody Eastwood, who scored 40 goals for the second time in his two seasons on Long Island last year, will also be key in turning the wheels of Stony Brook’s offense along with senior Mike Rooney. Rooney, heading into his last season with the Seawolves, is already tied for ninth on Stony Brook’s all-time point scoring list.

The Seawolves look to continue their string of recent success, as the group has reached the America East Tournament in each of the last 13 years. The team is returning 14 upperclassmen and 95 percent of last year’s scoring output. UMBC took third in the poll, followed by Binghamton, Hartford, Vermont and UMass-Lowell respectively.

UMBC was arguably the second-best team in the league last year, falling victim to the momentum of Albany’s thrilling semifinal win over Stony Brook in the America East Championship game.

The Seawolves finished off last year with a record of 6-10 overall. They also went 2-3 in the America East conference play. Two of their loses came to rival Albany. This included a 17-16 overtime loss in the America East Championships to end their season. The team sports 10 home games for the second straight season.

SBU will have its season opener at Kenneth P. LaValle stadium on Feb. 7 against Manhattan. After six non-conference games, including matchups against No. 3 Duke Blue Devils and the Fairfield Stags, the Seawolves take on No. 11 Albany at home on March 14 to kick off their conference schedule.

Other conference games include versus UMBC on March 21, at Vermont on March 28, at UMass-Lowell on April 10, versus Binghamton on April 18 and at Hartford on April 24 for the regular season closer.

After a couple of years to mature together, losing because of a lack of experience is no longer plausible. As the poll dictates, the Seawolves are expected to step up, starting now.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>By David Vertsberger and Zach Rowe</strong>

In need of a convincing victory over one of the conference’s elite, Stony Brook exhibited its defensive moxie in a 72-66 home win on Wednesday night over Hartford. Throughout the night, the Seawolves defense kept the game within reach despite their opposition leading nearly wire-to-wire.

The Seawolves lost their 2-0 lead at the 17-minute mark and would not retake it until just seven minutes remained in the contest. SBU made just three of its first 15 shots, falling behind 13-6 in the early going.

“In the first half we were lackadaisical. We didn’t have any energy in the first half, the first 17 minutes,” Jameel Warney, who finished with 13 points on 6-13 shooting, said following the win. “We didn’t know what they were going to throw at us in the first half. Every time they threw the ball to me in the high post to me, multiple people crashed down.”

Stony Brook was stifled by the Hawks’ uber-physical man defense and their scheme against the high-low. Warney’s first low-post touch came six minutes in, with Hartford’s defense collapsing on him whenever he came near the paint.

The Seawolves’ offense eventually got off the ground with a five-point spurt from freshman Deshaun Thrower, but Hartford would clamp down once again and jump out to a 23-14 lead.

Junior Carson Puriefoy could not find the bottom of the net, Stony Brook’s role players were unable to create opportunities, and Warney hardly got touches he could work with.

On the bright side, SBU’s defense shined throughout. Despite shooting just 38 percent from the field in the first half, Stony Brook allowed only two fast break points from the Hawks.

“They’re dangerous in transition because they make threes. We wanted to do a good job, I thought we had a good scout on them,” Head Coach Steve Pikiell said. “I thought our defense was good the whole night.”

It was this defense that never allowed Hartford to extend its lead past nine points. The Hawks leading scorer on the season, Mark Nwakamma, scored just 10 points on 4-12 shooting thanks to Warney’s pestering.

“Defense is obviously the main focus here. I had a bad offensive night but I feel like I can help the team in other ways,” Warney said. Stony Brook pulled within three points come halftime, when redshirt freshman Roland Nyama took over.

Nyama had just three points in the first half, but completely flipped the script in the final 20 minutes. “I was mostly looking at how they were playing me,” Nyama said. “First look is always to feed it to Jameel since that’s our best option. They weren’t looking for me so I just capitalized on them not really playing me and found angles, found the open lanes.”

Nyama finished with 22 points on 5-8 shooting from the field and 3-5 shooting from distance, sparking the Seawolves on both ends. With Hartford’s defensive focus on Warney, Nyama looked to create off the dribble aggressively, and it paid major dividends.

“It was great to see [Nyama] get loose, get energy plays, offensive rebounds, just playing with emotion,” Warney said.

“The way they were playing [Nyama,] he made that adjustment. He went by people, got to the foul line, they fouled him, got up in the lane,” Pikiell added. “If teams are gonna hug you on the perimeter like that, then you gotta make plays. He made plays, and as he made more he got more and more comfortable.”

Nyama’s play sparked a 15-0 SBU run midway through the second half, taking the Seawolves from an eight-point deficit to a seven-point advantage.

The run allowed Stony Brook to lean on its defense and timely buckets to coast to the win. Although Puriefoy struggled from the field, his defense in the final minutes was impeccable and he went 8-9 from the charity stripe.

“I love [Puriefoy’s] defense and that’s what we go on now. When he plays great defense he really helps us, and their guards are good.” Pikiell said. “I want to keep him focused on that end of the floor and when he’s locked in on that end of the floor it helps his offense too.”

With this 72-66 win, Stony Brook sealed its first win over one of the better America East teams this season, but on Saturday the Seawolves suffered one of their toughest losses.

Facing off against the University of New Hampshire Wildcats, the Seawolves looked thoroughly outclassed against their opponent, falling 63-48. The team shot just 31 percent from the field and failed to show its usual domination on the glass as the team fell to 6-3 in conference play and 15-9 on the season.

The Wildcats started out quickly, taking an early lead thanks to strong play from forward Taylor Leissner. Stony Brook lacked the offensive punch the Wildcats showed, and the UNH lead grew throughout the first half, which ended 29-25 thanks to a late run from the Seawolves.

However, the second half did not show the Seawolves making any significant adjustments to retake the lead. Right out of the gate, two three pointers from UNH’s Matt Miller put the Seawolves down by eleven.

From there, the game quickly got out of hand. The Seawolves never came close to threatening again, and the game came to a merciful end with the score 63-48. Warney’s play was the lone bright spot for Stony Brook that day. He put up a dominating display in the paint, putting up 20 points and 15 rebounds for his nation-leading 15th double-double.

However, his surrounding players failed to give him the necessary support. The normally solid Rayshaun McGrew had a weaker day, and junior guard Pureifoy struggled mightily on the offensive end, shooting only 2-10 with four turnovers.

Starters Ryan Burnett and Nyama failed to register a field goal on the day as well.

Sophomore guard Kameron Mitchell did flash much improved ball handling, leading the team with four assists. Facing an uphill battle for conference tournament seeding, the Seawolves will now host Vermont next Saturday.]]></content:encoded>

The Seawolves will take on the Vermont  Catamounts in Burlington on Wednesday, Feb. 4. BASIL JOHN / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

The Stony Brook women’s basketball team lost a game on Thursday night because of a battle that they won. With momentum shifting back and forth all night, it was Hartford’s rebounding in the game’s critical moments that allowed the Hawks to come back and beat the Seawolves in the final minute, with Deanna Mayza hitting a confident pull-up jumpshot to seal the 60-58 win.

Stony Brook’s team prides itself on its toughness and grit, which comes in handy every game. This is especially evident in the effort that the entire team puts forth in the paint.

On average, the Seawolves have plucked 8.7 more rebounds off the boards per game than their America East opponents, right behind Albany for tops in the league. Yet, against a Hartford team that Stony Brook always dominates in the rebounding department, the Seawolves only won the battle by one board.

That was the difference down the stretch, and a key offensive rebound that led to Mayza’s game-winner forced Head Coach Caroline McCombs’ team to play from behind in the waning moments.

Senior Sabre Proctor, who came off the bench with only minutes left in the game after a long sit-down because of foul trouble, had a deep look from three-point range for the win. But, it would not fall for the team’s leading scorer.

One could argue that the ball was in the right person’s hands. A busted play on the team’s first attempt for the win forced McCombs to draw up a play with only seconds remaining, making Proctor’s shot rushed.

If Stony Brook overcame the seventh best rebounding squad in the conference by a moderate margin on the glass like they usually would, it would not have come down to that.

But, there were some bright spots, in that the Seawolves saw contributions from faces not seen in the spotlight quite as often, slightly alleviating the time Proctor spent on the bench.

Junior Kim Hanlon, always a shooting threat from the outside on spot-ups, was far more active in this game. She nailed three long-range shots in her 11 point night. That tied her career high as a Seawolf, and her six rebounds were key to keeping the Hawks’ athletic forwards off the glass more than they already were.

Sophomore Kori Bayne-Walker has shown time and time again that she is the team’s most dynamic get-to-the lane threat throughout her college career, and Thursday’s game was no different.

Much like the men’s team’s Carson Puriefoy, Bayne-Walker used her explosiveness to get into the paint and draw fouls, getting to the line over and over in her 11 point, seven assist performance. Despite all the statistics, something that will not show up in the post-game notes was a key review with 1:22 left just after Bayne-Walker missed two free throws.

Junior Brittany Snow, as she always seems to do, negotiated her way around a box-out and fought for the rebound, which was heading out of bounds. The referees called it Hartford ball on the floor. Despite it appearing that the Hawks defender touched it last during a video review, officials maintained that possession would stay with Hartford.

Sophomore Christa Scognamiglio hit a key three-point ball with less than a minute remaining to tie the game, but one could only wonder what kind of a role the possible missed call would have played.

“I can’t control those types of things,” McCombs said understandingly after the game. “I just ask that my players give great effort, and whoever’s hand the ball goes out on, we just go with the call.”

Snow did put forth the effort, and it seemed to give the Seawolves energy on the defensive end to get a stop which would later allow Scognamiglio a chance to tie the game in the first place.

Despite the tough loss, bringing the team to 4-4 halfway through conference play, McCombs was happy with some things.

“Proud of our effort,” the first-year Head Coach said. “I thought we competed throughout the whole game. [It was just] a couple plays, they made one more play at the end of the game and that’s all that you need.”

In a major tone-setting game for the rest of the year, Stony Brook beat UNH 60-52 on Sunday, taking a step in the right direction against a solid team. The Seawolves lost to UNH earlier in the season, but came out strong against the Wildcats on the defensive end.

A nine-point lead in hand with only moments remaining in the first half, the Seawolves made a few careless mistakes to let UNH stay in touch.

Bayne-Walker, who was key in driving through the Wildcats defense early on, attempted to save a ball heading out of bounds, instead tipping it to her opponent who scored. A three-pointer on the next possession, and UNH pulled within four at the half.

But, the Seawolves managed to regroup in the big conference matchup against the same team they beat in the America East semifinals last season.

Leading the way was sophomore sharpshooter Scognamiglio. As she has done all season long, the guard hit long-range shots when they mattered most.

On the game, Scognamiglio connected on 3-of-6 three-pointers for 15 points.

Three other Seawolves also reached double digits in what once again was a team effort, a common theme for this year’s Stony Brook team.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For Stony Brook University’s Office of Emergency Management, the primary concern during last week’s snowstorm, and for any storm, is roadway and walkway safety, as well as coordinating with campus food service locations to provide ample time and places for resident students to get food, Lawerence Zacarese, director for University Police Office of Emergency Management and assistant chief of police, wrote in an email.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">“These things are directly related to our ability to direct snow removal contractors to the proper areas, roadways, etc,” Zacarese said. “Staying ahead of the storm, pretreating roadways and ensuring enough equipment/resources are in place are all crucial to this process.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Emergency Management monitors multiple forecasts from news sources and meteorologists, but primarily works with other emergency managers from around the state, along with a “dedicated group of forecasters from the National Weather service,” Zacarese said. </span>This provides predictions specific to the region, with briefings and conference calls before and during severe weather events, including hurricanes and tropical storms in the summer.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To monitor preparations for future storms, Emergency Management has what Zacarese called a “state of the art” Emergency Operations Center, which opened three months ago. The center included a staff of 15 to 20 employees at the height of the storm, according to a university press release. </span></p>
<p class="p1">The center’s staff is trained to evaluate and respond to emergency situations using the Incident Command System, which according to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, is an on-scene <a href="https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/ics/what_is_ics.html">incident management concept</a> “designed specifically to allow responders to adopt an integrated organizational structure equal to the complexity and demands of any single incident or multiple incidents without being hindered by jurisdictional boundaries.”</p>
<p class="p1">Emergency Management collaborates with facilities and residences for snow removal efforts as well as Environmental Health and Safety, C-CERT, SBVAC and external partners in the fire departments, Town of Brookhaven, Suffolk County and New York State counterparts, Zacarese said.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Besides emergency alerts received through SB Alert, Emergency Management sends out weather and emergency updates with its Twitter account, but sometimes takes on an informal tone with emojis, photos, hashtags such as #frozenseawolves and remarks such as, “Whats next during this #blizzard ??” during a blackout that affected dorm buildings while the winter storm
was ongoing. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">“I think levity is an important part of emergency management and keeping a sense of humor, particularly after being awake for 30 or 40 hours helps keep us sane,” wrote Zacarese, who handles the account with his assistant, Jason Casale. “I also think that it’s important to instill calm and provide a sense of reassurance. I think the humor and lightheartedness does that as well as connect to the 18-24 year old demographic of our students, even if some of my hashtags are lame or corny from time to time. #Itryhardnottobelame.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[1. Never doubt yourself. You’re right far more times than you are wrong (at the very least, I am).

2. Half of the time we ask for advice from others, we seek only validation for the choices we have already made.

3. Going to the gym is really, really great for your body. As is lying on the floor and staring at the ceiling for an hour. Figure out what your body needs that day.

4. Shame and guilt are the most crippling of feelings.

5. No matter how often people tell us not to take things and other people at face value, we still take things at face value. Understand how you display yourself to the world, and evaluate if that is the first impression you want to make. You may not care now, but there will come a time when you do. People are quick to judge a book by its cover.

6. Boys are really a whole lot better in theory (and as a side note, TSwift is 99 percent on-point about most things, listen to her album).

7. Figure out how to love people. Go to the gym with a friend every week, get lunch on Wednesdays, have sleepovers. It doesn’t have to be extravagant – it can be something as simple as remembering what they put on their burrito, or making tea when they come over.

8. The people you least expect to be friends with make the most brilliant friendships. The seemingly self-centered RA from freshman year can turn out to be one of the smartest people you’ve met, and the freshman that spends your first duty night with you before class starts can become a close friend two years later. Give people the chance to surprise you.

9. Let people in. I’ve proven myself to be a carefully guarded person, so saying what’s on my mind is my personal struggle. There’s no need to tell the whole world your problems, but it’s perfectly alright to not be okay. Talking to someone about it is a sign of strength.

10. There’s a stark difference between not knowing exactly what you want to do, and being aimless.

11. Eating is a pleasure. Enjoy everything you eat.

12. Saying “no” is a lot easier than everyone thinks it is. Do it more often. You don’t even have to give an explanation for your answer. It makes all the moments in which you say “yes” that much more meaningful.

13. Emotions and feelings suck a whole lot, but it’s far better to feel them out than ignore them. Burying them can be catastrophic for your future self.

14. The way I think I present myself and the way I actually come off to other people can be, and usually are, two very different things.

15. My major does not define how hard I work. My GPA does not define my intelligence. This is true for everyone. A student studying journalism works just as hard as one studying mechanical engineering. But if you tell me that Biochem is a thousand times harder than Heat and Mass Transfer, I will pray to every god that I believe in for you not to get into medical school.

16. Gut feelings always come about for a reason.

17. Figuring out what you want is hard, so understand what you don’t want to do with your life, and who you don’t want to be. It’s easier. I spent five years chasing someone else’s career path before realizing where my strengths and interests really lied.

18. Now is the time we discover that our parents are far from infallible, and can be wrong about many things. But everything that they do, that they say, comes from a form of deepest love that many of us don’t understand just yet. Forgive them.

19. There’s always a choice to make.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_34687" align="alignleft" width="595"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-34687" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/JT-and-Mila-Kunis-595x400.jpg" alt="Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis star in the romanitc comedy hit, &quot;Friends with Benefits,&quot; where the two start out in a complicated FWB relationship, but eventually end up together.

PHOTO CREDIT: GEORGES BIARD &amp; GAGE SKIDMORE[/caption]

Aside from the romantic comedy starring Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis with a cliché happy ending, no pun intended, what exactly is a friend with benefits (FWB), and more importantly, where can you find one? According to UrbanDictionary, friends with benefits consists of two people who enjoy a friendship and a sexual relationship without any emotional attachment. The lack of romantic feelings from both parties is the trademark of an FWB. Seems simple enough, right? Navigating the waters of this specialized relationship, however, requires the skills of a trained seaman. Again, no pun intended.

In an ideal friends-with-benefits world, two people can talk, catch a movie, order take-out and knock boots without having to go to Grandma’s 80th birthday bash. There are two general scenarios of an FWBR gone awry. The first occurs when the involved parties have different ideas of the intended happy ending, and no gentlemen, the lady is not always the one trying to change the meaning of “benefits” to include health benefits. As for my personal recommendation, when you get a phone call from someone who “just wants to hear your voice,” throw up your red flag, or dead bolt. Unless that statement is followed by something you wouldn’t want your mother to hear, he or she is likely planning to woo you with a flash mob in the middle of Grand Central Station. Consider yourself warned.

The second occurs when someone confuses friend-with-benefits with booty call. There is a certain degree of familiarity that differentiates the two, and it is this familiarity that takes your no pants dance to the next level of bedtime boogie. I have noticed that men seem to have a little more trouble grasping this concept than women, but nonetheless both parties can be guilty. So scroll through your text thread with your extra-special friend. Does every message from them include at least one explicit verb or a dictation of when his or her roommate is in class? Are they dressed and standing by the door before you’ve even found your underwear? Do they know your preferred pubic hair style but not your middle name?

I hate to be the bearer of bad news but you are not a friend with benefits, you are a sex buddy. While for some this is fine, many of us find this type of arrangement a little too crude for taste. If your find yourself in this situation, do not, I repeat, do not, try and convince this person to become a little closer with you. Yes, I understand that you are only looking to have some small talk between romp sessions and you’re much more comfortable breaking out the handcuffs with someone you can be certain won’t leave and forget to uncuff you. However, your casual suggestion of grabbing dinner before “bedtime” will be misconstrued as an attempt to transition from a casual sexual relationship to a monogamous one.

A note to men on this topic, a woman you are sleeping with can invite you to see a movie without caring what dream you had last night or other useless intimate details of your life. And if she is inviting you to a movie, it is because she wants to be closer friends with you without actually having to hear you speak. Yes, we plan things like that.

So why do we bother trying to have this kind of relationship if it’s such a difficult balance to maintain? Because we are busy. I am busy, juggling 21 credits, an internship, a job, hall council, student council, and a Netflix addiction. Adding a full-time relationship into my schedule, or yours, just does not fit. But that does not mean busy people do not want to get busy. It just means they have to be more selective about the time slots they have available. Having someone to share a few guilty pleasures with and without the obligation for Sunday brunch at the Union, fills in the available space nicely (I admit, this pun was a little intentional).

Trust me, there are plenty of reasons to bump uglies with your chemistry study buddy. If any of this appeals to you, then I personally invite you to join the ranks of college students who would rather feed the kitty without actually having to own one. And ladies, if anyone tells you that no man will buy the cow if he’s getting the milk for free, just remember you don’t have to buy the pig when all you want is a little meat.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Going hungry to stay on budget: meal plans not enough for nutrition needs</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_34739" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-34739" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/jpg-600x400." alt="Campus Dining / Megan Miller / Campus Dining" width="600" height="400" /> The average healthy meal on campus, consisting of fish, broccoli and brown rice, is $15.66. If students on the Bronze meal plan spend this amount per day, they would run out of money five weeks before the end of the semester. MEGAN MILLER / THE STATESMAN[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>This story is part two of a series on Campus Dining. </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Eating one meal a day is unhealthy, but for more than half of resident undergraduate students at Stony Brook University, a balanced diet may mean an unbalanced budget. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Tina Tiernan, Stony Brook University’s registered dietitian, wrote in an email that in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle, one should “eat three meals a day along with snacks.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Tiernan said those meals should include three out of the five food groups (fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy and protein) and snacks should include two out of the five food groups. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">“Skipping meals deprives us of the opportunity to fuel our body efficiently,” Tiernan wrote. “Depending on the type of food consumed, it may be hard to meet vitamin and mineral requirements through one or even two meals a day.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Tieran suggested for a more nutritious choice, students investigate Roth Market Fresh and order grilled fish with a side of vegetables and brown rice. The cost of a 5-ounce portion of blackened catfish is $8.80. The cost of a 4-ounce side of broccoli is $3.43 and the cost of a 4-ounce side of brown rice is also $3.43. Without any combo deals, the total cost of this nutritious choice is $15.66. If students on the bronze plan continued to spend $15.66 per day, they would run out of money approximately five weeks before the end of the semester.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Joan Stollberger, a registered dietitian in Smithtown, N.Y., said a balanced diet should consist of four to six small meals per day in order for an individual’s metabolism to run properly. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Three of those meals should consist of healthy proteins, ideally turkey or fish, good carbohydrates and fruits or vegetables. Stollberger said if possible, breakfast should be eaten as early as one can manage, lunch should be the most substantial meal of the </span><span class="s3">day, and dinner should be kept light, but that college students may not always be in the position to abide by this regimen. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">“Your brain uses one-third of the carbohydrates you take in a day,” David Karpf, a senior health sciences major and treasurer of the Stony Brook Strength Club, who recently began working at the Campus Recreational Center as the weight room coordinator, said. “You need to eat when you study. I don’t think people realize that.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">Karpf transferred to Stony Brook in the spring of 2013 and lived in both</span> Roosevelt and Kelly Quad until the fall semester of 2014, when he decided to move into the university’s West Apartments. He said his decision to relocate was influenced primarily by the fact he was unable to cook his own meals in either residence hall, since he did not live in a designated “cooking” building. When he lived in Roosevelt and Kelly, Karpf used the silver plan and stayed on budget mainly by eating late at night while he “intermittently fasted” during <span style="line-height: 1.5;">the day.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The cost per calorie on this campus is exorbitant,” Karpf said, who now uses the university’s “apartment duplex” meal plan, which costs only $500 per semester, as a backup. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The 2014-2015 rate for a double room at West Apartments, the room Karpf currently occupies, is $4,021, while the rate for a double room in a residence hall is $3,776. During his time spent in Roosevelt, Karpf not only paid for a double room, but also paid for his silver meal plan. Had Karpf maintained this living arrangement into the 2014-2015 academic year, his total cost for both meal plan and room would be $5,824. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Kylie Campanelli, a sophomore sustainability studies major who practices a vegan diet and subscribes to the bronze meal plan has also encountered difficulty meeting her specific dietary needs and staying on budget. Campanelli said she exhausted her meal points for the fall semester and purchased food both on and off campus with the money she makes as a barista at the Student Union Starbucks.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I do see a really big effort from Stony Brook to try and accommodate to vegans and vegetarians,” Campanelli said. “But it’s just that it’s all so expensive that it doesn’t matter if you give me those options. I can’t afford them.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Julia Martinez, a junior majoring in linguistics, abides by a strict kosher diet and subscribed to the bronze meal plan during her freshman and sophomore year. No longer on the plan since moving into a “cooking” building, Martinez can purchase food off campus to prepare in her dorm, which is equipped with a stove and oven.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But prior to that, she said, choosing the bronze plan came down to its price, though practicing the religiously restrictive diet left her funds strained. A single turkey wrap at Delancey Street, SBU’s strictly kosher dining facility, costs $9.13.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I went hungry a lot last year because it was so difficult to eat,” Martinez said.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">New diplomatic relations with Cuba are going to mean more than fancy cigars and chocolates for United States citizens.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Relations with Cuba are going to be more open in terms of travel, according to recent statements by the Obama administration. The administration seeks to enhance what White House press releases are calling an “outdated approach” and “promote more effective change in Cuba that is consistent with U.S. support for the Cuban people and in line with U.S. national security interests.” One element of the approach that will be expanded is travel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For university students, this could mean more opportunities to study abroad in Cuba.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Currently, Stony Brook University does not have a study abroad program in Cuba. But SUNY Oswego does, according to the Oswego study abroad website. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The way the SUNY study abroad system works is that any SUNY student can directly apply to any SUNY study abroad program. Therefore, Stony Brook students could venture to Cuba for study abroad through Oswego even though Stony Brook does not currently offer a Cuba study abroad program. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are 12 categories of traveling to Cuba authorized by U.S. law. To travel there directly from the United States requires an individual to fall within one of 12 specific categories, one of which is educational travel. General tourist travel to Cuba is still not permitted. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before the new foreign policy initiatives, people would have to make arrangements through the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control to get general licenses to travel to Cuba. This will still be in effect with the updated policy but the licenses will be easier to maintain. This change comes after 18 months of secret exchanges between the U.S. and Cuba, according to a report written in the New York Times.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Oswego program offers a semester abroad at the oldest university in Cuba, the Universidad de La Habana. Students are required to have an advanced or intermediate knowledge of Spanish because it is a direct-enrollment program.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This means that students admitted to the program will take classes alongside Cuban students.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The program was licensed in 2004 through the U.S. Department of Treasury. Students have the opportunity to take courses through the Faculty of Philosophy and History and take courses in sociology, anthropology, politics, history and philosophy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">SUNY students pay tuition to their home university and housing to the university in Cuba. So far this is the only SUNY program that operates in Cuba. </span></p>
<p class="p1">Representatives from the study abroad offices were not available for comment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The act requires each senator to propose a project within two weeks of the start of the semester in order to strengthen the campus community. (MANJU SHIVACHARAN / THE STATESMAN)[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This spring semester will be the first semester that the new Senator’s Project Act, which the Undergraduate Student Government senate passed Dec. 4, 2014 by a vote of 15-2-0, will take effect. The act will require each of the 22 senators to take on a project aimed at “strengthening the campus community” each semester.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Executive Vice President James Alrassi proposed the Senator’s Project Act this past fall, which is officially called the My Senator’s Keeper Act.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The act requires each senator to propose a project within two weeks of the start of the semester and to give a monthly report on his or her project. The act also prohibits senators from carrying over projects into a second semester.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Senators are expected to achieve the goals they proposed at the beginning of the semester,” the text of the Senator’s Project Act states.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Projects must be approved by the executive vice president, in consultation with the Executive Council and the administrative director.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Senators also can drop old projects and take on new ones with the approval of the Executive Council.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Much of the enforcement of the Senator’s Project Act would depend on the executive vice president. If a senator does not fulfill his or her responsibilities, the executive vice president can withhold the senator’s stipend by not signing the check.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Thus, if a Senator does not fulfill his or her requirements, two office hours, Senate meetings, committee meetings and now Project progression reports, I will not sign their stipend because they have not done the work required of them,” Alrassi said in an email.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Alrassi originally proposed another bill, the Senator’s Compensation Act, which was designed to pay senators for the workload increase caused by the Senator’s Project Act.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Senator’s Compensation Act would have raised each senator’s pay from $50 per week to $65 per week and the president pro tempore’s pay from $60 per week to $75 per week. But Alrassi said in an email he decided to scrap the Senator’s Compensation Act altogether.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“After talking with some Senators, they were okay will [sic] maintaining their current stipend,” Alrassi said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Had the Senator’s Compensation Act been passed by the senate and signed into law, the raises would have brought the annual total cost of senator stipends from $35,520 to $46,080, according to Treasurer Kathryn Michaud, who is also the chair of the senate’s budget committee.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Funds could be added to that appropriation through an appropriation act that would have to go through my committee from the unallocated funds,” Michaud said in an email. “However, this would result in the decrease of funds eligible for clubs that move up to line budget status for the spring semester and therefore programming for the student body.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The senate held a “symposium” on Jan. 20 and 21 to discuss the implementation of the Senator’s Project Act.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">President Garry Lachhar said at the symposium that the senators should not get stressed by working for USG because “it’s just student government.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Keith Olsen contributed to reporting.</i></span></p>]]></content:encoded>

"We avoided April since it would be too close to Brookfest," Chung said in a text message. <em>MPerdomo</em>[/caption]

In light of the Streetlight Manifesto concert contract mishap, the Undergraduate Student Government is reevaluating how they bring big events to campus and even more so how they operate as whole.

“USG historically has operated in a siloed structure rather than being a cross-functional organization,” USG Treasurer Kathryn Michaud said in an email.

In previous years, departments within USG worked independently from one another as opposed to as one cohesive unit. Michaud expanded upon this, saying that companies that work in a siloed structure are more likely to experience communication issues and organize similar projects to achieve similar goals. This wastes money as well as time.

And it was a communication issue that put the Streetlight Manifesto concert, scheduled last week, to a screeching halt.

“I just think it’s depressing because they had to cancel something that was pretty much going to be awesome just because there was some problem with the contract,” Bryan Huang, a freshman business major, said.

USG had not completed the contract when they made the announcement during winter break that Streetlight Manifesto was to perform at Stony Brook on Thursday, Jan. 29.

The contract was supposed to be completed early last week. However, with the advent of Winter Storm Juno, USG could not finish the process.

“USG is required to have a contract signed before announcing an event,” James Jr. Iannotto, a graduate student studying electrical engineering said in an email interview. Iannotto said he received this information last year from Mario Ferone, the former Vice President of Communications &amp; Public Relations, and Adil Hussain, the former president of USG.

After USG cancelled the concert, Iannotto posted on USG’s event Facebook page and stated that the organization had messed up the contract. Iannotto also provided a screenshot of a part of screenshot of a part of a conversation he had with John Mele, a USG senator, in which Mele urged Iannotto to remove his comment. The page was later taken down.

The contract issue highlighted communication problems within USG that its members are trying to rectify.

USG’s Vice President of Communications &amp; Public Relations Danny Chung said via text that the recent events are an indication of the “amount of work [USG needs]” to accomplish in order to improve internal communication.

“I am no exception to this and hope to address it immediately with the help of the Executive Council, Senators and affiliated parties,” Chung said.

USG release the truth behind the concert cancellation in an email sent to the student body on Friday. However, several Stony Brook students, like Shannon Conley, freshman history major, said that they had not received this email.

Chung said that conflicting explanations for the concert cancellation prompted the email sent out.

The message briefly detailed the reason for why the concert was cancelled.

It also explained the importance of cancelling the concert more than 24 hours prior to the scheduled performance.

For USG, 24 hours meant the difference between getting back significant amounts of money spent in preparation for the Streetlight Manifesto concert and losing it.

According to USG’s email because the show was cancelled more than 24 hours in advance, USG successfully cancelled additional services needed for the concert and avoided “financial implications.”

Michaud could not provide The Statesman with a breakdown of the event’s expenses, as USG is in the process of rescheduling the concert.

Chung said he is not aware of the amount of money lost due to the cancellation of the concert, “however, it seems that losses (if at all) will be very minimal and will not impede any of our future events.”

According to Chung, members of the Student Activities Board led the planning of the Streetlight Manifesto concert. They are taking full responsibility for the cancellation of the concert.

Although students like Iannotto said the the email is a step in the right direction for USG, he said that it is not enough. Iannotto did not receive the email sent by USG but saw it from a friend.

According to Michaud, USG is making steps towards improving how they work together to prevent similar event and overall mishaps in the future.

“We have started to develop a team charter that will outline our objectives as an organization, key projects and operations, each person's role in the team, and the way we will communicate and work together moving forward,” Michaud said.]]></content:encoded>

With conference play in full swing, Stony Brook women’s basketball will head to Vermont on Wednesday night to take on the Catamounts.

The Seawolves earned a major momentum boost after coming up with a big win over New Hampshire on the road Sunday, bringing their fifth place America East record to 5-4 on the season.

For Stony Brook, the game against Vermont is a winnable one, and could be a great help in continuing the Seawolves' late season push.

The Catamounts come into the game with a variety of on--the-court problems: the team is currently in the midst of an 11-game losing streak, and has failed to win any of its eight conference games. Vermont is also last in the America East in both scoring offense and defense.

Stony Brook must continue its stellar defensive play on Wednesday night in order to make sure that the Catamounts' losing streak continues. The Seawolves currently hold the best field goal percentage defense in the America East. Since Vermont is shooting at just 31 percent, a solid defensive outing could shift things in Stony Brook's favor.

This game will require Stony Brook to put its past road struggles behind them, continuing the new trend that the New Hampshire game started. Despite an 8-3 home record, the team is just 4-7 in road games this season.

While Vermont may not be quite the power that Albany is, it should be noted that two of the Catamounts' three wins came in home games.

In order to succeed in the conference tournament, the Seawolves must learn to play at a higher level away from Island Federal Credit Union Arena.

Put plainly, it would be a disappointment if the Seawolves did not win this game. With a 5-4 conference record, Stony Brook cannot afford to lose. Doing so would do great damage to the team’s hopes for a better seed in the America East tournament.]]></content:encoded>

<em><strong>By Arielle Martinez, Hanaa’ Tameez and Kelly Zegers</strong></em>

A Stony Brook University alumna is suing the university for the manner in which the administration allegedly handled her complaint of sexual assault by another student.

The lawsuit was filed on Jan. 23, 2015 with the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, in White Plains. Judge Nelson Stephen Roman will preside over the case.

<i>The Statesman</i> is withholding the names of the plaintiff and her alleged assailant, who is currently a Stony Brook student and is also being sued by the plaintiff, due to the sensitive nature of the allegation. At the time of publication, neither could be reached for comment.

The plaintiff, a former social work major, alleged in the complaint she was sexually assaulted by a male student in his dorm room during the early morning hours of Jan. 26, 2014 after attending a party at West Apartments with him the night before.

She alleged that the man switched her mixed drink with straight liquor, causing her to become deeply intoxicated. After the two started kissing and the plaintiff tried to stop the encounter from going any further, the defendant allegedly “overpowered” her, according to the complaint.

The complaint also details that the defendant allegedly forced her to perform oral sex at least twice, once by pinning the plaintiff down by forcing his knees onto her shoulders and once by pushing her head down to his penis. She alleged that she blacked out several times during the attack due to a combination of trauma and intoxication and is therefore unsure as to whether the defendant forced her to engage in vaginal intercourse with him.

The plaintiff reported the incident to the University Police Department, was examined by a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner and reported the incident to the Office of University Community Standards, the complaint states.

The plaintiff states in the lawsuit that campus police “were aggressive and intimidating in their questioning of her” and failed to investigate the case fully. It also alleges that the plaintiff was told by the unnamed detective that she did not have a “viable case” because “she did not scream ‘No’ or violently fight back in order to stop the attack, and that, while she could go to the District Attorney’s office, prosecutors would probably feel the same way about her case.”

Assistant Chief of Investigations and Administration of University Police Neil Farrell was not immediately available for comment.

The plaintiff then reported the matter to the Office of University Community Standards, which scheduled the disciplinary hearing during the plaintiff’s final exams and less than a week before her graduation ceremony in the spring of 2014.<strong><strong>
</strong></strong>

The plaintiff was allegedly informed that “she would be responsible for prosecuting her case” during the hearing.

“The process of prosecuting her own attacker, while also defending her own version of the facts, put [the plaintiff] in the impossible position of being her own surrogate lawyer while finishing her college education, attending to her job responsibilities, and suffering the trauma of the original attack,” the complaint alleged.

On May 22, 2014, the day of her first graduation ceremony, the plaintiff was informed the alleged assailant was found not responsible.

After receiving the written basis for the hearing panel’s decision, dated July 9, 2014, the plaintiff filed an appeal.

In a letter dated Aug. 28, 2014, Director of Campus Recreation Jay Souza allegedly advised her that after reviewing the case, he “found no evidence that the Hearing Board considered the definition of consent found in the University Code of Conduct and/or applied that definition to the facts of this case” and that the finding “constitutes a significant procedural error warranting the granting of your appeal.”

The lawsuit states the plaintiff was also notified she would be contacted by the Office of University Community Standards with the next steps in the process but after repeated attempts on the part of the plaintiff to establish contact, no university official provided any “substantive response” or further steps.

Souza declined to comment on the matter.

Stony Brook University is already under <a href="http://sbstatesman.com/2014/08/15/stony-brook-among-colleges-and-universities-targeted-for-investigation-regarding-response-to-sexual-violence-cases/">investigation</a> by the Department of Education for possible violations of Title IX, the federal clause that prohibits discrimination based on sex at any federally-funded educational institution. An April 4, 2011 <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201104.pdf">letter </a>from the Department of Education Office of Civil Rights clarified that Title IX’s definition of discrimination based on sex includes sexual harassment and assault.

“Stony Brook University takes all claimed violations of Title IX very seriously and is committed to prevention of sexual assault and violence on campus,” SBU Media Relations Officer Lauren Sheprow said in an email. “We have policies and procedures in place to fully investigate every such claim that is brought to us. We are unable to comment on litigation, as Federal privacy laws prohibit us from disclosing student information, and await the court's consideration of the full record.”

Earlier in January, Stony Brook also declined an offer from the Association of American Universities to anonymously survey the campus about the prevalence of sexual assault at SBU.

“While we appreciate the AAU effort in this process, as part of the Board of Trustees resolution on sexual violence, SUNY will be developing its own campus climate survey, in which SBU is required to participate,” Director of Title IX and Risk Management Marjolie Leonard said in an email in January.

Leonard was not immediately available for comment regarding this lawsuit.

Director of Office of University Community Standards Matty Orlich, who oversaw the plaintiff’s case at Stony Brook, was also not immediately available for comment.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[First of all,  "not realizing" she went from a mixed drink to straight liquor has absolutely nothing to do with the verdict. She was not making a complaint about her drink, she was making a complaint about the fact she was sexually assaulted. Second of all, he is still considered the "alleged assailant" because this is an appeal of the original verdict where he was the alleged assailant.  
Now let me make this completely clear and obvious... just because she did not say "no" does not mean it was consensual. Not saying anything is not giving consent. When someone is intoxicated to the point where they are blacking out, then they do not have the ability to give consent and any acts done to them is assault. The only form of consent is if she said "yes", which she did not.
Stop victim blaming. Stop Rape Culture!]]></wp:comment_content>

First at thing she should have said to aggressive police is " I want my attorney here, now!" The second thing she should have said was "I want to call my parents, NOW! The third thing she should have done was stop talking. Period.

"The plaintiff states in the lawsuit that campus police “were aggressive and intimidating in their questioning of her” and failed to investigate the case fully.

Don't worry about being 'blamed' by your parents, get them involved RIGHT AWAY!  Don't take no or anything else for an answer.  Don't go to campus authorities, go directly to the police AND the DA, with your attorney. 

No is no. Personally, I see someone disregarding this and he will be minus two testicles.  Then you can sue me!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[It's not "blaming the victim." We ONLY have her word. We don't know what was "taken" from her or "denied" by UPD, you're jumping to a conclusion.


I know it feels good to stand up for victims of sexual assault, and I agree! But this whole story is incredibly fishy. There have been no publid records released and all we have are allegations from an obviously biased individual in the matter.


Rape hysteria is just as much of a problem as victim blaming. There is no reason for us to make judgments about this, as people who have no idea what happened. UPD seems to have dismissed her grievances. She's understandably upset. But the rights of the accuser are never weighed differently than the rights of the accused.]]></wp:comment_content>

Whether she consented or not isn't up to us. Consent is not "saying yes." You don't say "yes ok" when you have sex, that's ridiculous.


He's an "alleged assailant" until he's found by a court of law to have been an assailant. Not by the public, not by UPD, not by this girl, and not by her attorneys.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA["She alleged that the man switched her mixed drink with straight liquor, causing her to become deeply intoxicated. "   This statement is obvious blame shifting.   It is an implict claim that she recoginized at the time that it was straight liquior,myet she choose to drink it.   It was her choice to becom drunk if she in fact became drunk.   There is no allegation he used a funnel to force it down her throat at the party (and no witnesses) so getting drunk was her choice.   That she now blames her choice on a third party is a flaw in her mental processes.  She chose to drink hard liquior and not liking the result of additional bad choices on her part like going back to his room for sex wants to blame shift her drinking choices on him.

She is also doing the same thing with the campus police and the university.   She was presented with a whole series of choices her which she took and now that the outcome was not what she desired she's blaming everyone except herself.   She chose not to pursue rape charges with police.  She chose to have the hearing. She chose to participate as her own representative.  Etc.  Yet her she is suing and thus blaming others for her choices.

Also "deliberate indifference" sure sounds like an distorted euphemism of "just impartiality".   Her expectation not to be questioned about her allegations of events is irrational.   

Lets take her claim that the defendant forced oral sex on her bynusing his knees to pin her shoulders.  It seems physically impossible to complete a forced blow job in this fashion, as it would completely limit any mobility on of his hips in relationship to her mouth.    If his knees were literally on her shoulders there would likely be bruising.  Unless his penis is long enough to reach his knees it would not reach her mouth with his knees on her shoulders.   Even if he has the required eighteen or more inches it would also need to be independently prehensile in order to perform the requisite in and out motion.   

This is just one way in which her story is fishy so of course the campus police are going to ask questions.  Here expectation that everyone take her word unquestioned is ridiculous.  It's highly likely that the individuals involved picked up on her irrational blame shifting and became uncomfortable in talking with her, hoping not to be her next victim.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[That's a distorted representation of a robbery.  No robber just stands next to his victim and waits for money to be handed over either.   Usually a robbery commences with a demand for money with no quid pro quo.  As a victim of a robbery you don't get anything out of it you didn't already have.   That's true even if the robber offers to spare you harm or death.  That is true even with a pick pocket.  Only one side benefits.

A consensual sexual encounter doesn't work this way, as both parties can get something out of it, desired pleasure.    If a girl unzips a guys pants, pulls it out and gives a BJ, but he never says "yes" that is not a sexual assault.   He had every opportunity to say "no".  Plus if he had been on a date with her and had consented to returning to her room where this happened it is clearly an implicit yes.  An implicit "yes" happens all the time with sexual encounters, kisses, touching, etc.      

If on the other hand she is some stranger who pulls a gun on him at the park, points it at him before unzipping his fly then that would be equivalent to a robberry.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Being found not guilty is not the same as being found innocent.  The meaning also depends on the standards being applied in the hearing or trial.  Not guilty could mean there was no proof beyond a reasonable doubt, or it could mean that the preponderance of the evidence showed no crime was commited.   In this case the accused is more likely to be innocent because the burden the accuser faced in showing a crime was low.   This however is never proof of innocence.   Nor was it shown the accuser was lying.  With these kangaroo courts there is no danger to the accuser of being ruled a liar.   With actual rape charges mad to police there is not only the possiblility of the accuser being found a liar, but also facing criminal charges, a trial, and punishment.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA["Plus, anyone who doesn't drink often/already had a sufficient amount to drink could quite possibly not notice the alcohol content of what they're drinking. "

You are a very poor at coming to conclusions.   That is not consistent with her claims.   Implicit in her claim is that she did notice.   Not only did she notice a higher alcohol content but identified it as straight liquor.   You are fabricating points not in evidence and quite contrary to her actual story.    

This is the point at which the investigtors would quite naturally ask more questions like, " what were you drinking?".  If she said, "screwdrivers" then they might ask, "So how did you realize it was 'straight liquior'"?  At whichnpoint she might say, "It was strong with no orange juice."

She seems to object to this entire quite reasonable process.]]></wp:comment_content>

No, they turned it over to a decision making body that investigated, held a hearing or hearings, and dismissed it.  She can always go to police.  She is alleging rape and that is a crime.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The very fact that kangaroo courts are being established on campuses is evidence of rape hysteria.   The police should be used.   Other evidence of rape hysteria is the use of false and ridiculous claims, like that 1 in 5 women are raped on campus.   This was unquestioningly repeated by politicians going all the way to the president of the US.   Yet, it was always false but none of those pushing the hysteria bothered to use an ounce of skepticism.   Turns out that DOJ statistics show it is false.    

Plus there has been a long list of provably false allegations being used a poster children for the hysteria.    The Duke rape case, UVA, mattress girl, Dunham, have all been show to have made things up.   If you have a strong hand all your moves won't be bluffs.  These cases where the ones hand picked by the hysterics to prove thier point and yet they still failed.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA["We don't know if she's a victim. Period."    

Yes, we don't.  Athough it would never be her fault if she was raped, she could be partially or wholly responsible for the fact that we could never determine the actual facts.   In this case she went back to the accused's dorm voluntarily which makes it much more difficult to determine whether a rape occurred. 

I could leave $300 on a picnic table at the park because it was making me uncomfortable during a hike.   It truly is the responsibility of everyone who sees that $300 not to steal it.  They know it is not theirs.   I wouldn't be responsible for the theft itself.    I would however be responsible for making it easy for the criminal, and making it hard to catch and convict them.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA["Do you have any idea of how high the bar is for this kind of thing to make it as far as it has"


Yes, the bar is set incredibly low.  In fact so low that it violates the constitutionally guaranteed rights of the accused.  Which is why colleges are going to see and lose many lawsuits brought by falsely accused victims.   Colleges should not be running these kangaroo courts and should instead refer any accusers directly to the police.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[You have a real problem Brian.  The act of systematically responding to every single post in this thread is indicative of either a fellow rapist trying to justify their own actions in another case or a friend of the perp trying to exonerate him via social media.  The fact that you did it so long after the comments were made (months) may indicate the former.

It always amazes me how people like you think they are so smart that nobody could possibly figure out their motives.....]]></wp:comment_content>

Your charge that I'm a rapist because I responded to a bunch of comments is absurd.  It also goes towards showing the hysteria involved here.   He's been charged with being a witch and anyone who doesn't condemn him as a witch and stands up against a lynching is also a witch.  That's your reasoning.  It's an appalling display of immorality on your part.

This is exactly what happened in the Twana Brawley case.   She accused anyone who had the brains to see through her inconsistencies and lies.   It's also a common tactic of the left.]]></wp:comment_content>

I don't need to use any such non-sequitur however.   You blatantly accused me of being a rapist.  You are a false accuser.

First, I actually have a son in the Stonybrook chemistry/geology program for the last three years, so you might actually call me a stakeholder.  That means I pay a lot of money to educate my son and expect the school to provide a safe and fair experience-to ALL. students!  

Second, I actually do know the name of the student who was taken advantage of.  You would too, if you actually knew how to do some independent research instead of just posting the output of your spleen as a response.  This student (I'll let you figure out how to find her name, it's rather easy but you need to begin slowly lest you hurt yourself) would not be filing this lawsuit if 'nothing happened' as you insist.  You obviously don't have grown children, perhaps because you're not grown up yet yourself.

I reiterate my first supposition, your reaction to my post and your confession at the end of your post was all the indication I need to understand you very well indeed.  Anyone with an education beyond high school could see it plainly...]]></wp:comment_content>

Henry's book "The Four Million," written in 1906. <em>GISELLE BARKLEY / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

Most people are willing to dish out more money for their significant others come Valentine's Day. Steak, especially filet mignon, is one the more expensive proteins, but when seasoned and cooked right, it is well worth the cost.

This cut of meat is the tenderloin of the beef. The name "Filet Mignon" is simply a fancy way of saying beef tenderloin steak according to <em>Food Stuff</em>.

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

Ingredients:

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

Two 4-ounce filet mignon

Small red potatoes

Green beans

Basil (fresh or pre-ground)

Garlic powder

Black pepper

Salt

Parsley (fresh or pre-ground)

1 stick of butter or extra virgin olive oil

¼ cup red cooking wine

¼ cup Balsamic vinegar

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

First, grab two sauce pans and set both on the stove on medium heat. Place some of the butter or olive oil in one of the pans as the stove is heating. This pan will be used to sautée the potatoes and the green beans.

Cut the red potatoes into halves and place into the pan. Sprinkle garlic powder and parsley on top of the potatoes. Add the green beans and mix the ingredients in the pan to spread the seasoning. If you used olive oil and like salty vegetables, you can add some salt, but be careful as garlic powder is already salty.

Stir the ingredients occasionally to make sure the vegetables do not burn as they cook.

While the vegetables cook, season both sides of the meat by sprinkling on basil, garlic powder, pepper and a pinch of salt. Once again, be careful when seasoning the meat with both garlic powder and salt.

To cook the meat, you need a lid for the second pan. Place the meat in the pan either prior to or after adding the red wine and balsamic vinegar. Lower the temperature to medium low heat when adding the red wine and balsamic vinegar.

Regardless of when you add the red wine and vinegar, be careful when pouring them into the pan.  Balsamic vinegar has a strong smell when heated.

Cook the meat for one minute on each side or until browned. If you have not added the red wine and vinegar yet, lower the temperature to medium low heat and carefully pour the ingredients into the pan. Cover the meat with a lid and cook for four minutes on each side.

If it is your first time cooking this type of meat and you are unsure how cooked the meat is, either use a meat thermometer or carefully cut the fillets down the center to check. This is also called a butterflied fillet.

Keep an eye on the potatoes and green beans. If you like softer potatoes, try and cut one with a spoon as it cooks. If a spoon can cut the potato with ease, then the vegetables are ready. If you do not like the potatoes very soft, taste one of the pieces and continue to cook to your liking.

When the meat is ready, place the fillets on a plate and drizzle the remaining red wine balsamic glaze onto the fillets. Add the vegetables to the plate and enjoy a romantic dinner for two. This is also a great recipe to cook with or for a group of friends.

STATESMAN<em> STOCK PHOTO</em>[/caption]

After finishing first in the CAA in passing defense last season, Stony Brook football Head Coach Chuck Priore made it a point to make sure that happens again. He welcomed six defensive backs, including two from the same high school, in a recruiting class that totaled 19 new Seawolves as National Signing Day comes to a close.

14 of those recruits signed National Letters of Intent, while four were junior college transfers and one was a mid-year post-graduate transfer.

The Seawolves gathered seven recruits from their own state: one from Longwood and six from the New York City area, with three coming from the Bronx and then one each from Yonkers, New Rochelle and Mount Vernon.

The Archbishop Stepinac duo of Damarcus Miller and Gavin Heslop take their talents to Stony Brook after shutting down receivers for the Crusaders for four years and garnering first team all-state honors, as voted on by the NYSSWA.

Miller finished his senior season with 68 tackles and four interceptions, while Heslop finished his final high school campaign with 60 tackles, three picks and three sacks. He had two interceptions, returning one for a touchdown in the AAA championship against Iona Prep.

Another defensive back, Chris Cooper, arrives from ASA College after finishing his high school career at Iona Prep. He achieved first team all-state as well in high school and then finished fourth on the team in tackles with 27 and added three pass breakups.

Flipping to the offensive side of the ball, there is the fourth and final NYSSWA first team all-state honoree Isaiah White. The running back from Longwood earned the Hansen Award, making that two award winners in the backfield as he joins Stacey Bedell.

The other three New Yorkers who signed their letters of intent today were defensive lineman Odean Gilzene, offensive lineman Jaelen Vazquez and cornerback Synceir Malone.

Olan Abner, the lone recruit from Massachusetts, earned first team all-state honors from ESPNBoston.com. The Beford High School graduate finished his senior season with 105 tackles, four forced fumbles and an interception.

From Massachusetts to Maryland, there was another all-state member signed to Priore’s squad this season. Offensive lineman Joe Detorie earned 2A/1A All-Maryland honors while being named to the Baltimore Sun’s All-Metro second-team offense.

Closer to home in Connecticut, Ryan Hovan reached an agreement to join the Seawolves in 2015. Before spending a year of post-graduate  at Choate Rosemary Hall and being a part of a team that won the New England Class A Championship, he spent his high school career at Ansonia High School where he was a part of the coaches first team all-Connecticut.

Stony Brook was able to get eight players from the three big states of high school football in California, Florida and Texas.

Among the class from the Sunshine State is Travis Liburd, who attended Piper High School. He was a two-time all-Florida member and led Broward County in rushing as a junior and senior, finishing with 1,865 yards and 16 touchdowns in his senior season.

From Orange Park, Fla. is a kicker/punter who will look to give Stony Brook a cure to its woes in the kicking game. The Seawolves missed five extra points and two of their eight field goals last season, and it is Alex Lucansky who looks to be the answer. The Bolles School graduate is ranked as the No. 9 punter and the No. 17 kicker/punter on Hall of Famer Ray Guy’s ProKicking.com.

Deep in the heart of Texas, there were two commits who signed their letters of intent today. Linebacker DeAngelo Hubert led South Grand Prairie High School with 95 tackles his senior season, 73 of them being solo. He also finished as a second-team all-district linebacker.

The other Lone Star State commit was from Euless, Texas. Raymond Bolden did not play in 2014 after going out to Moorpark College in California, but was a first-team all-Northern Conference in 2013 at the school. He finished third in the conference with 802 receiving yards on 60 catches and accumulated five touchdowns.

Out west, there are three Seawolves making the cross-country trip to play on Long Island, headlined by defensive lineman Sam Awrabi.

The Clovis, Calif. native played two years at the University of Wyoming before going to Fresno City College last year. He finished last season with 26 tackles (6.5 of them for loss) and 3.5 sacks. Coming out of Clovis East High School, he was ranked as the No. 81 linebacker nationally on Scout.com and was the No. 66 California recruit by Rivals.com.

Whoever becomes quarterback next fall will have a big-play receiver to throw to in Lakewood graduate Nick Anderson. The 6-foot-2-inch wide receiver finished last season with 24 catches for 445 yards and a pair of touchdowns while being named first team all-Moore League.

Bradley Meeks is the final recruit from the West Coast, as the Chaparral High School graduate will look to make an impact in 2015. The Temecula, Calif. native was voted team MVP as a senior, recording 32 tackles and an interception on his way to being named first team All-Southwestern League as a defensive back.

Stony Brook’s first game next season will be on Sept. 3rd, when The Seawolves play at Toledo in a Thursday night opener.]]></content:encoded>

Manager Matt Senk’s Stony Brook baseball team will start the 2015 season where they left the 2014 regular season: right at the top. The Seawolves entered the 2014 America East Tournament as the top seed and regular season champions, finishing 15-2 before losing two games to Binghamton when only needing to win one in the final round.

Stony Brook received five of the seven first-place votes to total up 35 points in a poll of the league’s seven coaches in which you are not allowed to vote for your own team.

Maine finished in second with 28 points, followed by Binghamton with 25 and Hartford with 22 to round out the top four, with the Bearcats and Hawks garnering the other two first-place votes.

A team that lost the likes of Kevin Krause and Brandon McNitt to the draft, the Seawolves have a lot of optimism going into this year.

Stony Brook has been dominant in regular season play in the America East, winning three of the last four regular season titles, but only taking one of those conference tournaments. That was in 2012, when they made the magical run to the College World Series.

The Seawolves return six position players, including All-America East shortstop Cole Peragine, second-team outfielder Jack Parenty and freshman All-American Casey Baker.

The young pitching staff will be led by second-team honoree Tyler Honahan and America East Rookie of the Year Cameron Stone. The Seawolves sport five freshmen in their pitching arsenal and have no seniors.

The team as a whole is very young, with only two seniors on the squad and 14 freshman on a 31-man roster.

The Seawolves will open up their season on Friday, Feb. 13 with a three-game series at Nicholls State in Thibodaux, L.A.

They will start their America East play with a championship rematch, hosting the Binghamton Bearcats for a three-game set from March 14-15.]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1">In her new book called “Valuing Deaf Worlds in Urban India,” Stony Brook University medical anthropologist Michele Friedner explores not only the ways in which deafness and disability are perceived, but also the ways in which these individuals are valued in the postcolonial society.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">“Anthropology is very important because it allows us to think about questions of sameness and difference and to think about how other people’s experiences might be different from ours,” Friedner, who has been researching the experiences of deaf and disabled individuals in India since 2003, said. “Anthropology forces us to consider and reconsider how we know and what we know, and it gives us the tools for analyzing.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A professor in the School of Health Technology and Management and a member of the Society for Disability Studies, Friedner began her journey at Brown University, where she earned her B.A. in religious studies in 2000.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I majored in religious studies and focused on Indian religion,” she said. “It was interesting to look at India as a place that has been constantly changing—change from the very beginning, in terms of colonialism, development, and economic growth.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Six years later she earned her Master of Arts in anthropology from University of California, Berkeley, and in 2011 she earned her Ph.D. in medical anthropology from University of California, San Francisco. She then went on to conduct her postdoctoral research at MIT in 2014. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today, she is professionally associated with the editorial board of Disability Studies Quarterly and the editorial collaborative of Somatosphere: Science, Medicine, and Technology.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Growing up in Jackson Heights, New York—a cultural melting pot resting in the heart of Queens—Friedner was able to experience wide-scale diversity at an early age.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Most of my friends growing up were actually from India,” she said. For this reason, she was </span>driven to study the country and all it had to offer, from its religion and values of interdependence, to its social, moral and political structure.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She found, however, that it was not enough to conduct idle research and form assumptions based on preconceived notions. The anthropological work she was interested in required communicating with individuals by spending time with them in their native land. It required her traveling to India nearly every year since 2006 and living in the country for two years, once from 2008-2009 and again from 2013-2014.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We have a very specific view of deafness and disability in the U.S.,” Friedner said. “Deafness is considered a political disability here, and I wanted to see if that was the case in India too. When I got to India, I was fascinated to see that a lot of the discourse there was the same as in the U.S.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She said that only certain groups of people used such isolating language (i.e. labeling deafness or disability as a legal or political issue) and that those groups were often those who had access to westernized education and social media that allowed them to communicate internationally. Even so, she identified some key misconceptions about the general perception of deafness and disability in India.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“People think that deafness and disability are viewed very negatively in India, that those who are deaf or disabled are experiencing very bad karma, have done something terrible in their previous life or that it’s a result of how backward they think India is in the way it views people,” Friedner said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“In fact,” she said, “what I found in a lot of cases was that people who are deaf and disabled are treated better in India than they are here [in the U.S.].”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Providing the Americans with Disabilities Act as an example, she said that deafness and disability has become a largely legalistic issue in the States and that this is an unfortunate situation because it prevents an “informal, interpersonal means of communication.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She touched on a unique experience she encountered while researching in India of a deaf blind man who worked in a government bank making photocopies.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“People would come over to him and give him the paper they wanted him to copy, and they would trace in his palm the amount they needed and the size of the paper,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She regarded this instance as a very nice interpersonal relationship and said that such informal, everyday accommodations were not uncommon. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But local businesses are not looking to give relief and equal opportunities to deaf and disabled citizens, Friedner said. Such corporations are exploiting this force of disabled workers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“They don’t pay very well and the jobs are very unstable because of the economy,” Friedner said. “These companies have realized they can hire disabled people as a new force of immobile workers. It looks good for the company and the customers who read this in newspapers see how wonderful it is—but in fact, these are not very good jobs.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She added that in this way, the deaf and disabled are forced to carry the brunt of manual labor. Citing the Specially-Abled KFC in India, which opened in March 2013 by the Yum! India team and “received the Presidential award from India’s President Pranab Mukherjee for their outstanding performance as an employer of people with disabilities,” Friedner said the deaf and disabled are often trapped in jobs they do not like or in positions in which they are at the mercy of big businesses who thrive upon their disabilities.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Similarly, she mentioned the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD) and how its comprehensive new human rights treaty is being signed with great fanfare, but little focus on the specific values of each culture at play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“India has signed it and promoted it,” she said. “Interestingly, the U.S. has not signed it and refuses to sign it, because it says [the treaty] is going to usurp American sovereignty. The question is, who’s really benefiting, because in India, disability rights laws have not been changed and the value system is very different.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Essentially, Friedner said, it is important to determine whether creating a universal treaty that meets all demands and protections of deaf and disabled persons around the world is even possible, taking into account the vast differences in values and knowledge systems of each society.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“So much of it really does depend on the context in which people live,” she said. “One thing that is very unique about deaf people across the world that I’ve encountered, is the desire to communicate, and make meaning and understanding happen. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Because deaf people are typically excluded in the mainstream environment in the sense of communication, they are often very skilled at making communication happen. The ability to gesture, mime, and be very creative about making meaning happen is not so widely seen in every group of people.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She mentioned how interesting it is to see how the deaf and disabled are often on the vanguard of change and the role they have played in technology and development in general. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">She also mentioned that most deaf and/or disabled people do not want to be seen or thought of as inspiring or special merely because of their disability. That, she said, is yet another form of pity that ties into the poor identity policies in the U.S.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It is also a burden to the disabled themselves, and it comes to the point when we have to reexamine how we think about difference,” Friedner said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She said that overall, technology is not always a good thing, as in the case of the rising IT jobs that are not as wonderful as they are made out to be. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She also said that people who work in technology development are very interested in finding ways to eradicate deafness by things like cochlear implants, but that this is not what most deaf people she has spoken with want. What they want is a more universal reliance on sign language and an ongoing effort to make communication possible, regardless of their disability.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Men&#039;s basketball looking for split in season series against Vermont</title>

ANDREW<em> EICHENHOLZ / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

This Saturday night, the Stony Brook men’s basketball team will be back on its home court at Island Federal Credit Union Arena for a 7 p.m. tip-off with the visiting Vermont Catamounts.

The Seawolves currently sit at 6-3 in conference play and are looking to rebound after a disappointing performance on the road against New Hampshire last Saturday. The loss to the Wildcats came despite a dominant 20 point, 15 rebound game by Jameel Warney.

The supporting cast for Stony Brook struggled in the game. Carson Puriefoy, Rayshaun McGrew and Roland Nyama combined to shoot just 18.2 percent from the floor, combining for nine points.

Bryan Sekunda was one of the few exceptions. He had a strong game off the bench for the Seawolves, knocking down three three-pointers for nine points.

Vermont sports an 8-2 America East record, with one of those wins coming against Stony Brook four weeks ago up in Burlington, Vt.. The Catamounts won that matchup 71-57 behind a balanced scoring effort—all five of their starting players tallied at least nine points.

Stony Brook’s shortcomings in that game resembled the aforementioned recent loss to New Hampshire. Warney played a strong game, scoring 26 points and grabbing ten boards, but Puriefoy, McGrew and Nyama combined to shoot 20 percent.

So far in conference play, Stony Brook is 0-3 in games where Puriefoy scores fewer than eight points and 6-0 when he meets that threshold.

Defensively, Stony Brook will look to eliminate the three-pointer. The deep ball has been an Achilles’ heel for SBU this season; they are 48th in the country in two-point defense and 232nd in three-point defense.

Vermont made six threes in the teams’ meeting last month, sparking roars from the crowd and from which Stony Brook could not overcome.

Warney is averaging 15.7 points per game and 11.2 rebounds per game this season, and is tied for the nation’s lead with 15 double-doubles on the year.

Leading the Catamounts is Ethan O’Day, a junior forward who is averaging 10.8 points per game this season.

Stony Brook is just 8-22 all-time against Vermont, but has fared better recently, particularly at home. The Seawolves have won three straight regular season home games against UVM, including a 67-64 victory last season.]]></content:encoded>

For nearly one-third of the American populace, Super Bowl Sunday is an artificial holiday that involves gathering around a T.V. screen and watching grown men fight, grapple and hit each other in the hopes of attaining the Vince Lombardi Trophy.

Meanwhile, many of us sit back and loudly cheer for one of the two teams while we stuff our faces with buffalo wings, pizza and beer, loudly claiming that we could have totally made a better game strategy than Bill Belichick or Pete Carroll.

Arguably, though, I am sure I could have made some better play calling in that last minute than Carroll, but I digress.

Super Bowl XLIX was, for all intents and purposes, a much better Super Bowl than the previous year. We saw two teams actually playing in the game, not just one team dominating the whole 60 minutes while the other prayed that it would be over so that they could go and rack up endorsement funds from Papa John’s Pizza.

On top of that, this year’s Super Bowl featured more than just an actual game between two teams. It was a year of horrible ads, dying kids, a half time show with an artist’s rendition of what Gilligan’s Island would look like if they dropped acid and proof that if there is a God, he really does not want Tom Brady and company to win a Super Bowl, as evidenced by some receiver making an impossible catch in the dying minute of the last three Super Bowl’s in which Brady played.

However, this nigh-impossible catch was overshadowed by the “Immaculate Interception,” or basically Carroll thinking that his $10 million running back, Marshawn “Beastmode” Lynch, was clearly incapable of running half a yard, and instead decided to make Malcolm Butler feel like the greatest defensive back to ever play the game.

I would be a liar if I told you I did not jump off of the couch and loudly cheer when Butler made that interception, mainly because I was happy to see Seattle lose after the way they embarrassed my Packers in the NFC Championship Game. Also, the thought of watching the obnoxious Seattle fan who ridiculed all of the Packers fans at the bar I was at while they historically collapsed have his heart break just seemed so righteous and just.

On top of this, watching Richard Sherman’s heart break on national television was also just as amusing to watch, being that his constant smack talk and arrogance was really just starting to get under my skin. However, I am sure that he will feel alright about the loss after he wipes away his tears with hundred dollar bills while I stock apples and peaches on a wall.

The actual game is not the only reason why many people watch the Super Bowl; in fact, many watched it just to see Katy Perry perform at the halftime show. While many said that Perry stole the show, I believe that it was really her dancing shark compatriots that really were the highlight of the performance. Personally I think she actually sounded terrible live and that the auto tune that she uses on her records became extremely relevant after the first song she performed.

The other reason why people also may watch the Super Bowl is for the ads, though this year’s ads were anything but good. Whether it was Nationwide’s commercial featuring kids who died due to accidents or Kim Kardashian’s data stash commercial, many of this year’s advertisements did not live up to a lot of people’s expectations. There were some companies, like Budweiser, that had halfway decent commercials, but not many that really stood out. At least, not in a good way.

From breath taking plays to dancing sharks, all the way to dying kids and horrible play calling, this Super Bowl will be one to remember for a while. For some people and companies, they will be remembered for the good that they did. For others (Nationwide and Carroll), it will go down in infamy. It is okay, though, at least that kid from the Nationwide commercial did not have to see Seattle blow it on the final play.]]></content:encoded>

The number of cases in January has already outnumbered those diagnosed last year. <em>PHOTO CREDIT: PATH GLOBAL HEALTH</em>[/caption]

Recently, the United States has been struck by a measles outbreak, with cases in the month of January already outnumbering the cases diagnosed last year. The measles outbreak started in California’s Disneyland, finally providing “It’s a Small World” a challenger for the worst part of visiting that theme park.

Why has measles come roaring back? Well, it is tied to why it went away in the first place.

As with many other viruses, vaccines have been able to monumentally reduce the number of those stricken by measles in the first place. Recently, however, vaccines have come under fire. The movement claiming that vaccines cause serious health issues has gained quite some momentum over the years. Now, the debate has reached the highest levels of government, with political leaders taking stances on making vaccines compulsory for the public. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie came out in support of giving parents the right to choose, while Kentucky senator and shockingly real doctor Rand Paul claimed vaccines could cause “mental disorders.”

The vaccine debate can be divided into two debates, one seemingly one-sided and another occupying a more gray area. The first debate is whether to vaccinate your child. The pro-vaccination side has the backing of thousands of scientists and doctors, countless scientific studies and institutions such as the CDC and the WHO. The anti-vaccination side is lead by noted porn star and e-cigarette spokeswoman Jenny McCarthy. The evidence is so overwhelming that this debate is simple: vaccinate your kid. However, the idea of the government forcing parents to vaccinate their child presents a more interesting debate on the rights of both an individual and a guardian.

The debate hinges on the scope of two rights: the right to control one’s body and health, and the right of a parent to control their child’s health.

The idea of the government forcing a legal adult to inject a substance into his or her body sets a dangerous precedence, if nothing else. Yes, herd immunity exists and vaccines are a public health issue, not a private one. However, we do not exist in a vacuum and legal precedence is a dangerous thing. It takes a degree of trust in the government to give them such power. Many people fail to empathize with others who lack this trust in the government and it spills out into other debates as well, from gun control to privacy rights.

However, to a government accused of spying on its own citizens and selling out to corporations, we offer too much trust. People should have a right to their own body and what gets put in it. Undoubtedly, vaccines are beneficial, but they represent a forfeiture of rights many have and should have pause about.

So we address the issue of whether a guardian has the right to control the body and health of his or her child. For vaccines, like any other health issue, a choice must be made. An infant certainly cannot make the choice for itself. Therefore, either the government or a guardian must make that decision. Many times, the government would make the right decision. However, it remains that many would prefer the right to remain for the individual to make the wrong decision rather than the right be withheld by the government so it can make life changing decisions.

Indeed, legal precedence seems to favor those against compulsory government vaccines. The right to one’s health and one’s body have been protected by the Supreme Court. Issues like abortion or sexual activity have been found to fall under the privacy clause of the Constitution, allowing one the right to control one’s body. This is not a new idea either. John Locke once wrote that man “has a right to decide what would become of himself and what he would do, and as having a right to reap the benefits of what he did.” The right to one’s body is a vital, intrinsic right, and we must defend it despite making sacrifices.

Legal precedence also favors the right of the guardian, shown in a popular news story. The saga of the struggle between a husband desperate to end the life vegetative wife and governor and presidential trilogy completing hopeful Jeb Bush’s attempts to stop him was widely publicized in recent days. The end result of the story was that the husband, the legal guardian of his wife, had the right to end her life and the government could not stop this. This story, while not a complete parallel, casts an interesting light on the right of a parental guardian to control the health of their child.

Look, in a perfect world, the best result of this debate would be a giant, blinking billboard with the words “Vaccinate your kid.” It is a vitally important public health issue. Without vaccines people have died, and people will die. However, we have to do this without compromising our rights. Vaccinations are an issue of public education, not public compulsion. The right to one’s body should be held inalienable and the thought of ceding that right to the government should be seen as downright Orwellian.

Defending vaccines is seen as a life or death fight. Defending your basic human rights should be as well.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It is 2015. I am a modern day woman.

The world is my audience: expecting everything of me, expecting nothing from me. There is a quiet, understated acknowledgement that maybe, I can do something. Maybe. When I fail, I am dismissed. There is a slight eye roll, a small scoff and an acceptance that I could not have done it anyway. Why did they even bother to hold hope?

In 2015, I am held back by all the stereotypes that have come before me and growing into the new ones that are set out for me. I am every archetype ever studied. I have the kindness of the mother, the virtue of a virgin, the allure of the slut and coldness of the shrew.

But above all, I am helpless. I could be the result of the events in life that I choose to affect me, but instead I am the tragedy of everything that happens to me anyways. I am weaker, because years and years ago someone placed me in a box, and told me to stay. Now, I am trying to escape, but constantly being pushed back in.

It is 2015. I still can’t get out. Not without a husband. Not without a boyfriend. Not without a man by my side. Without a husband, my life is not truly fulfilling. I am only lying to myself and the world if I stay single. A boyfriend would protect me from wandering eyes at the bar. I can shake my head and say “no” all I want. It means nothing unless he steps in to claim me.

I am taught to stay in at night. To keep quiet because I couldn’t possibly be correct. I am led to a life full of children and dirty dishes. I am told to be conservative. I am told to be careful because it will be my fault. Everything is on me. It is ingrained that I can only rise so far by myself, only protect my body to a certain point, before the situation is completely lost from my hands.

It is 2015. I need something else. I demand more. I cannot be watching over my shoulder at every night. I cannot control every boy at a party or dictate when the drugs fall in my drink. Covered up in Saudi Arabia or stripped down in New York City, eyes will always follow me, jeers will always taunt me. So why is this my responsibility?

Why am I to blame for every switched drink? Why am I so cautious, when the world around me continues on with reckless abandonment? Why isn’t he smarter? How does he not realize that changing my drink, silently bringing me back to his room, forcing me against my drunken will—is anything but appropriate? Who began to think that because of my sex, I can be dominated, taken control over and ruined?

Why are there still people who see me, the modern day woman, in the same light?

I am told that boys and men can protect me. I see that those boys and men can hurt me. And I am watching as the people who could help me, ignore me. I feel my own pain, bear through it with a strong face, only to get it thrown in my face in the name of “justice.” I am lead on with empty promises of help, only to be dismissed, to be neglected, to be marginalized. Suddenly, I am something to be hidden, to not speak of, to not acknowledge. Suddenly, I am placed back in a box.

It is 2015. I am a modern day woman.

The world is my audience: expecting everything of me, expecting nothing from me.

But I am casting the judgment this time.

And I am watching as the world continues to fail me.]]></content:encoded>

Chris Christie, for example, has announced his belief that parents have the right to choose whether to vaccinate their children or not.<em> LOS ANGELES TIMES / Tribune News Service</em>[/caption]

I wrote several articles for <em>The Statesman</em> last semester and was honored, not to mention grateful, when my editors offered me my own column over winter break. My uncle, when I told him this, offered me a great piece of advice: don’t be overly negative.

There are too many people in the newspaper and media business these days who do nothing but complain and lament, he said.

He is right. Negativity and anger are often used as fuel to garner high ratings or a larger readership. So as I thought of what I would like to write about, I decided that I would start off on a positive note. I had planned to write about my first semester at Stony Brook and all these amazing experiences and opportunities I had presented to me. It would be full of praise for the university that often gets the short end of the stick from many of its students, including at this paper.

I would still like to write that article, but I am afraid that it will have to wait. Something much more pressing, and unfortunately more negative, has come up.

Gov. Chris Christie, on the second of this month, told reporters in Cambridge, England that he and his wife have vaccinated their children, but that he also understands “that parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well,” and, “that’s the balance that the government has to decide,” according to the Washington Post and other major news organizations.

Christopher, what in the hell are you thinking? As one of my colleagues at the<em> The Statesman</em> said when we discussed topics for the week, “vaccinate your stupid kid you idiot.” If a childless college student can give better parenting advice based solely on common sense than a father of four and the Governor of New Jersey, the Governor has some serious issues to get past.

The growth of the anti-vaccination movement in the last decade has created a vulnerability in what was a near perfect system tasked to defend the masses from various diseases. Some children cannot receive certain vaccines for an assortment of reasons ranging from allergies to immune system disorders. However, these children should generally be safe because the majority of the populace that surrounds them will be vaccinated and the exposure to the diseases vaccinations prevent will be minimal. Once parents stop vaccinating their children because of celebrity-sponsored fear mongering, the odds of being exposed to and subsequently spreading the diseases goes up significantly.

There is no legitimate scientific evidence that indicates vaccines are related to autism risks, the most notable complaint out of the anti-vaccination movement. That doesn’t stop a small, yet still significant, percentage of parents from putting their children and the children of others at risk.

After Christie made his comments, and international headlines, his team quickly released a statement saying he “believes vaccines are an important public health protection” and insisted “there is no question kids should be vaccinated.” His fellow Republicans jumped to his aid, echoing the backtracking statement’s sentiment, but many, including 2016 presidential-hopeful Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, stated they believed that it was not the government’s place to mandate vaccines.

Public leaders like Christie and Cruz and Barack Obama (who stated that he believed science on vaccines in relation to autism was inconclusive back in 2008, but who has since become vehemently pro-vaccines, particularly in recent days) have an ethical obligation to not give movements with dangerously idiotic causes encouragement or a sound bite to use.

By conceding that there should be an open conversation when there should not be, these politicians are giving an ounce of legitimacy to those who are anti-vaccine, furthering their cause. They get more media coverage and while most will denounce them some uneducated, easily influenced, or overly concerned mother will join them and their numbers will grow, putting more lives at risk.

This whole ordeal is one of the more deadly products of the anti-science tendencies that have been embraced by the right wing of the American political landscape. The anti-vaccination movement is actually an issue with support from the far reaches of both side of the aisle, but in large part it is the Republican Party who has become the “Party of No.”

Republicans use to be the Party of Progressivism (way back in the days of McKinley the Dead, Roosevelt the Moustached, and Taft the Large) who supported preservation of natural resources and dabbled in fighting the unregulated industrialists of the day. If the Republicans want to be taken seriously on a national level they need to stop battling science on principle. They do not believe in climate change. They do not believe being gay is not a choice. If they jump the Democrats to the punch and become the party of progressivism again, letting the battle against science whither and die, they will have a chance to maintain national relevancy, initiate their own economic reforms and fight for social issues they actually have a foot to stand on. They should choose to focus on abortion and marijuana legalization if they truly believe the first involves the ending of a human life and the second is an unnecessary vice. I am not saying they are necessarily right or wrong, but there is actual, legitimate debate to be had when it comes to those issues, unlike gay marriage, environmental protection and vaccine usage.

Christie made the comments he made because he is seriously considering taking a shot at the White House in the coming years. He will not win, his shtick only works in places like New York and New Jersey, kind of like Giuliani, but he is probably going to try anyway. Like many Republican presidential candidates, he thinks he has to cater to the far right, the radical Tea Partiers, the kind of people who do not vaccinate their kids and think being gay is a lifestyle choice, as former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas said last month.

Christie, who is generally considered to be a moderate, feels he has to appeal to the Tea Party if he wants to stay with the pack. He does not. He should not. And as loud mouthed as he can be, a political figure in his position should make sure what they are saying does not accidentally encourage people to act dangerously and in a way that has potentially fatal consequences.]]></content:encoded>

BASIL JOHN / THE STATESMAN[/caption]

Following a week free of games, Stony Brook jumped out to one of its most impressive halves of the season before playing perhaps the worst 20 minutes of its campaign in a 57-48 home loss to Vermont.

“It was the tale of two halves,” Head Coach Steve Pikiell said following the loss. “I thought we played great in the first half and then obviously they played great in the second half and we didn’t have enough to win down the stretch. Our effort was good, you have to make some shots and they made every one in the second half. Hard to beat a team that’s shooting the ball like that.”

SBU had the Catamounts on the ropes early, with Vermont calling a timeout just two minutes into the contest after a quick 4-0 spurt by the Seawolves. Hector Harold picked up two early fouls and Vermont could not find the bottom of the net whatsoever.

The Catamounts made just one of their first 13 tries from the field and picked up five team fouls by the midpoint of the first half. Stony Brook’s defense was beyond stifling, precise and ferocious. All five players on the court were hyperactive every trip down and the Catamounts could not find an open look.

Vermont went into halftime with a scoring rate of .469 points per possession. That number is astoundingly low, especially from an offense that had so much success against SBU in the two teams’ previous meeting.

The only thing holding Stony Brook back from a tremendous lead was its own offense. Vermont fronted Jameel Warney effectively and applied too much pressure for the high-low pass to come through.

Warney still got his low-post touches, but shot just 4-14 from the field in the first half.

“I thought we could have had a bigger lead, I was really disappointed at some of our turnovers and some of our missed open shots,” Pikiell said. “I thought Jameel got a ton of open looks that he normally converts for us.”

Junior Rayshaun McGrew was relatively silent offensively, but Carson Puriefoy looked like his usual self with an eight-point first half on smart takes to the basket.

As a whole, Stony Brook shot 31.6 percent from the field in the first half, but only knocked down a single three in the first 20 minutes.

Despite this, the Seawolves carved out a 14-point lead at the break that extended to 17 at the 14:30 mark of the second half.

Then, the tables turned.

“Their defense is so good, they usually hold teams to 15 in a half. We knew we’d have a struggle to score tonight, just because everyone struggles against them to score,” Pikiell said. “To be honest I was surprised we had 29 at halftime. I knew a drought would come because of their defense.”

This drought lasted the entirety of the game and manifested itself in a 36-10 run for Vermont.

Stony Brook made just four of its next 19 attempts from the field and turned the ball over eight times in the latter half compared to just three giveaways in the first. Its offense completely stalled and Vermont capitalized on the other end with a 42-point half on 72.7 percent shooting from the field.

“We had great effort, we just couldn’t make shots. Like coach said, tale of two halves,” Warney, who finished with 14 points and 15 boards, said. “Hats-off to them, they’re a good team. They shot very well in the second half and we couldn’t score.”

This enormous run only secured the lead for Vermont at the 5:44 mark on an Ethan O’Day jumper. O’Day scorched Warney and the Seawolves down the stretch with 12 points in the final 10 minutes.

“He can drive, he can shoot, but when it was winning time he delivered and I didn’t,” Warney said. “We’ll get better, we’ll be in that moment again and we’ll be successful.”

Stony Brook was still within reach come crunch time, though. With under a minute to go, Vermont had possession with a three-point advantage.

Cam Ward ran a pick-and-pop with O’Day at the top of the key, with Brandon Hatton, who finished with 12 points, sitting in the right corner. Redshirt freshman Roland Nyama, who was on Hatton, sprinted to the middle of the floor to check O’Day, leaving Hatton open for the dagger three.

“We made a mistake on that,” Pikiell said. “[Nyama] helped a little bit too much. He’s also supposed to do two things on that play: he’s supposed to bump high and then he’s supposed to recover and he was a little late on that. At that time they were already feeling it.”

Vermont knocked down its free throws to secure the 57-48 win. No Seawolf outside of Warney or Puriefoy finished with more than four points.

“I think everybody we have is extremely capable. We just had an off night in the second half. We trust our team, we trust our teammates,” Puriefoy said. “They’re all good players, we just have to keep feeding them the ball in their spots and they’re going to hit shots.”

The Seawolves now drop to 6-4 in America East play, good for fourth in the conference and 15-10 overall.

“Obviously it’s a letdown, but our confidence isn’t shattered by any means. I think we can learn from this and come back stronger,” Puriefoy said.]]></content:encoded>

BRIDGET DOWNES / THE STATESMAN[/caption]

The Stony Brook men’s lacrosse team started its 2015 campaign on a gloomy, sometimes snowy day at Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium, as if the disappointment of a heartbreaking loss to Albany in the America East Semifinal last year followed them until now.

“It’s fuel for the fire,” junior attackman Challen Rogers said about the heartbreaking end of last season earlier in the week. “We want to go further than we did last year for sure.”

That fire showed early and often against Manhattan, as Stony Brook’s offense was large and in charge in the 19-3 win. After the junior Rogers and senior Mike Rooney switched positions—Rogers transitioning to attackman and Rooney to midfield—one would think it would take a while to adjust.

Instead the duo, which had made the move temporarily in the past, had no difficulty. In fact, both Rogers and Rooney scored two goals to propel the team to a 4-0 lead in the first quarter, which would never be challenged.

“Well, I mean last year we switched a few times during the season,” Rooney said. “It’s the same thing with our offense, just share the ball.”

Share it they did, as nine different players recorded a point on the day.

In fact, junior Brody Eastwood, who is known for scoring goals right outside the crease, set a teammate up for a goal, notching only his third career assist in his third season on Long Island. That assist ended up in the netting of sophomore midfielder Alex Corpolongo’s stick.

The Purdys, N.Y. native was one of three Seawolves who scored four goals on the day. The thing is, Corpolongo only managed three total in his freshman campaign.

“He’s just a great, great kid. He works extremely hard on his shooting, He’s one of the hardest working guys on our team,” Head Coach Jim Nagle said about the sophomore. “We’re really committed to going with him, we know he can really shoot the ball.”

Rogers noted that there is more than just a core group of scorers on the team. While Eastwood and Rooney led the team last season in goals, everybody can contribute, and in different ways.

“That’s like our whole team, next man up,“ Rogers said about the lack of selfishness in Stony Brook’s performance. “Anyone on our team can go out there and score [and] pass.”

Junior Matt Schultz, an attackman who was third on the team in goals scored last season, had none on Saturday. However, he led the team with four assists, making an important contribution despite not burying any of his seven shots.

Junior long stick midfielder Dylan Curry even managed to add to the goal tally. He raced into the midfield on a rush as seconds ticked a way in the half, launching what was an unlikely shot from long range, nailing it top shelf for his first goal of the year.

Despite the Seawolves coming out of their opener in a stadium filled more with ice and snow than fans, Rogers summed up the performance best.

“On to the next one,” he said. One pass at a time. One possession at a time. One game at a time.

Stony Brook next faces its lower-New York rival St. John’s this Saturday. The team will travel to Queens looking to avenge last season’s 13-11 loss at Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium.]]></content:encoded>

Coming off the team’s previous win at New Hampshire, the Stony Brook women’s basketball team put up impressive offensive numbers against Vermont and came away with a 74-62 road victory over the Catamounts on Wednesday night.

Stony Brook continued its recent domination over Vermont, as the Seawolves have compiled five victories in the last six games against their conference foe.

A trio of Seawolves topped the offensive game, as all three hit double-digit point totals. Both Kori Bayne-Walker and Sabre Proctor set the pace for scoring in the game with 23 points each.

Bayne-Walker also helped facilitate the offense by contributing six assists and drawing plenty of fouls while hitting nine of her 10 free throws.

Rounding out the trio of double-digit scorers for Stony Brook was Christa Scognamiglio, who dropped 15 points. She came up big from behind the arc, hitting four three-pointers on five attempts.

On the defensive end, it was Jessica Ogunnorin controlling the boards with 15 rebounds. No one came close to matching her rebound total as the player with the next-highest total was Niki Taylor of Vermont with six.

As a result of the performance from Ogunnorin, the Seawolves continued to dominate the boards as they have done all season long, finishing with a plus-11 rebound ratio, totaling 37 rebounds to Vermont’s 26.

Stony Brook also shot well from the line with an 80 percent free throw rate reaching the line 20 times in the game.

Kayla Burchill of the Vermont Catamounts led her team in scoring with 18 points. She would also finish second on the team in rebounding with five boards.

Stony Brook came out of the gates hot with a 12-2 lead under five minutes into the game. The lead would eventually dissipate, as the Catamounts would gain their footing and climb back. Although the lead shrunk for the Seawolves in the middle stages of the night, they never trailed and led for over 36 minutes.

Nearing the final minutes of the game, Stony Brook took over and put together a sequence of successful offensive and defensive series.

With a few Vermont turnovers and Stony Brook steals, the Seawolves were able to push a double-digit lead and close out the game handily.

The win moves Stony Brook to 13-10 with a 6-4 America East record. The Seawolves are now 4-1 on the road in conference games and will look to improve their play at home.

As the team moves forward, it will need to take one game at a time, as the race to the postseason is heating up and is doing so quickly. With the Seawolves jumping ahead of a very solid team in New Hampshire for the moment, it will be important to maintain their top-four seed in the conference.

Stony Brook may even have a chance to catch up to rival Hartford, the team right ahead of them in the standings by one game, with wins on Wednesday and Sunday against UMBC and Maine, respectively.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>By David Vertsberger and Andrew Eichenholz</strong>

[caption id="attachment_34974" align="alignleft" width="600"]<a href="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/BPJ_0688.jpg"><img class="wp-image-34974 size-medium" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/BPJ_0688-600x400.jpg" alt="BASIL JOHN / THE STATESMAN" width="600" height="400" /></a> Jessica Ogunnorin (above, No. 3) going for a shot under the basket in Stony brook's game against Binghamton. Ogunnorin was key to the Seawolves' streak-ending victory over Albany last year. BASIL JOHN / THE STATESMAN[/caption]

<em><strong>Point #1: The Stony Brook men’s basketball team needs to figure out how to beat Vermont.</strong></em>

The Seawolves are now 0-2 against Vermont on the season after losing their latest matchup with the Catamounts on Saturday, 57-48. If Stony Brook wants to reach its first NCAA Tournament, the Seawolves will likely have to top this conference foe come March.

One of the biggest advantages Vermont has over SBU is Ethan O’Day, the lanky 6-foot-9-inch forward who has had little trouble scoring on the Seawolves. O’Day scored 16 points on 12 shots in his first meeting with Stony Brook and added 17 points on Saturday. He has lots of length, a great touch in the post, range and quickness. He is essentially Jameel Warney’s kryptonite, meaning SBU may have to go about different means of covering him.

Then there is Vermont’s defense, the 43rd-best in the country according to kenpom. In their first meeting, the Seawolves got 26 points out of Warney, but just 31 points on 9-37 shooting from the rest of the squad.

On Saturday, only Warney and Carson Puriefoy scored in double-digits and they only shot 12-32 combined doing so. If Stony Brook wants to top this Vermont squad, they need the stars and some of the role players to make shots.

<em><strong> Point #2: Jessica Ogunnorin can be a difference maker for the Stony Brook women’s team.</strong> </em>

When Stony Brook beat Albany to end the Great Danes’ 38-game America East winning streak in the last contest of last year’s regular season, it was Jessica Ogunnorin who made the difference. Scoring a then-career-high 18 points, she showed quite a variety of tools at her disposal.

She can get in the lane, shoot and rebound as well. To tell the truth, she can do just about anything on the floor and may be the most athletic player on the team. But, she has not done so game in and game out like Seawolves fans see from classmate Sabre Proctor.

That does not mean, however, that as the games get more and more important as the America East tournament arrives, that she cannot change that. For the first time since conference play began, Ogunnorin led the team in rebounding against New Hampshire with 11 and did it again against Vermont by snatching 15.

If she can get her scoring going, Stony Brook will be a dangerous team come tournament time.

<em><strong>Point #3: Ryan Burnett making positive impact as a starter.</strong></em>

After rarely coming onto the court through Stony Brook’s first 20 games, Ryan Burnett has started for the Seawolves in each of their last five games, replacing freshman Bryan Sekunda.

This wing slot has now seen three suitors, with Burnett being the latest. Stony Brook is 3-2 since the change, but that record says little about what this switch does for the team. Burnett’s rotation is often the first few minutes of the contest, then the final few minutes of the first half followed by the opening minutes of the second.

From what we have seen, he is a stupendous leaper that corrals offensive boards as if he were in a zero-gravity environment. His shooting has been streaky, but his effort level and length defensively has made him useful as a catch-all wing instead of a specialist.

Outside of Burnett, this move has allowed Head Coach Steve Pikiell to play shooters Kameron Mitchell and Sekunda together in recent games, providing lineups with all the spacing they could have asked for.

Whether or not Burnett remains a starter is left to chance. We may even see freshman Deshaun Thrower starting at some point in the future. It is too early to tell one way or another, but this deep into the season, Pikiell is not afraid to keep experimenting with his squad.

<em><strong>Point #4: Stony Brook’s women’s team needs to take things one game at a time.</strong></em>

Not one team in the America East wants to deal with Albany. Annually one of the best mid-major programs in America, they are extremely tough to beat. Stony Brook learned that the hard way last year, getting thumped following its huge win over the Great Danes preceding the tournament.

That is why every game the rest of the way matters so much. Head Coach Caroline McCombs would probably say that the Seawolves are taking it one game at a time anyway, and they certainly will not take whoever their opponent is in the first round of the America East Tournament lightly, but they would prefer to potentially have to play Albany in the finals rather than have a semifinal matchup looming over their head.

The Seawolves are just one game behind Hartford, who broke their hearts in a battle at Island Federal Credit Union Arena on Jan. 25, but earning that third seed back from the Hawks will, in the long run. be of the utmost importance in hopes of a playoff run.]]></content:encoded>

HEATHER KHALIFA / THE STATESMAN[/caption]

“That’s one of my favorite quotes,” Kameron Mitchell said as he pointed to an hourglass tattoo on his right arm with the words “time waits for no man” embedded with it.

Time has certainly not waited for the 6-foot-4-inch sophomore.

Just a year ago, Mitchell was struggling to find consistent playing time for the Seawolves. Today, he is a pivotal role player that not long ago led a charge to upset the No. 13 Washington Huskies.

In a month, Mitchell will be tasked with a major role in Stony Brook’s push towards its first NCAA Tournament berth.

“Coach calls me a veteran. Every time he says ‘you’re one of the veterans’ I’m like, ‘wow I’m only a sophomore.’ With our young team I kind of have to be a veteran, I have to teach some of these guys the ropes,” Mitchell said. “They haven’t really had the experience that I have.”

And to think, Mitchell very nearly did not end up at Stony Brook, or even playing basketball for that matter.

“I played football, basketball and baseball up until high school,” Mitchell said. “Then, my sophomore year in high school, I wasn’t growing, so my basketball coach kind of influenced me to give up football. I played quarterback so I was kind of too small. He encouraged me that I would be a better point guard than I would be a quarterback so that’s when I made that decision.”

This encouragement paid off for Mitchell, who dominated in his last two years of high school to the tune of 23.2 and 21.5 points a night for Mandarin High School in Jacksonville, Fla. Mitchell was “more of a facilitator” early in his high school career, but being given “the green light at all times” by his coach helped him develop the stroke that makes him so deadly today.

Mitchell originally committed to Wagner College, but after a major coaching change, Mitchell reopened his recruitment and immediately focused in on Stony Brook.

“Stony Brook was the school that was interested all along,” Mitchell said. “I always told [my high school coach,] I want to get away, I’ve been here too long, I’ve been here my whole life, so just want to do my own thing so that’s why I came here.”

Mitchell averaged just 8.4 minutes a night in his freshman year, having to adjust to the college game. Playing mostly point guard in high school, Mitchell’s ballhandling and playmaking did not translate well. The same goes for trying to stay in front of opposing point guards. Just under a quarter of Mitchell’s plays ended in a turnover in his rookie campaign.

“When I first came, I was hesitant, because I didn’t know what shots to take, how to read the offense, how to play,” Mitchell said.

Even in a forgettable first season, Mitchell’s future seemed bright. There were glimpses and what-ifs, but also a few things that stuck out as truly promising. For one, his ability to draw charges.

“I feel like I have a quick first step, so I’m pretty good at anticipating another person’s first step. If I feel my feet are planted and I’m in good position, I’ll just try to take one,” Mitchell said. “I’ve been taking charges my whole career, but here I really started to put that into my game because I needed to find my way on the court.”

Then, there was the emotion he brought to the floor. “It’s just natural. I’m a very competitive person. I’m a very, very competitive person,” Mitchell said. “When I feel like I contribute to a win or do something to get my team going I’m going to act on it and make them know, ‘yeah let’s go,’ try and get them going.”

Finally, there was his jumper, which connected on a solid 38.1 percent from downtown. “I try to get the ball on the shoulder in my shooting pocket and I try to make sure I follow through my wrist,” Mitchell said. “If I get the ball on my shoulder and I can get lined up with the basket I feel like it can go in, any shot I take.”

Coming into this season, Mitchell was a completely reinvented basketball player, moving over permanently to the wing spot to adding lots of muscle to having his head coach call him the team’s best perimeter defensive presence. However, Mitchell lost his starting position to freshman Bryan Sekunda 10 games into the season.

“I didn’t think anything of it,” Mitchell said. “I still had the same mindset going into every game, go in and play good defense, try and help my team.”

The change did wonders for Mitchell’s and Stony Brook’s game, however. The Seawolves are 10-5 since the switch after starting off with a 5-5 record. Mitchell’s defensive energy picked up and he was finally looking like the dependable “three-and-D” wing SBU needed him to be.

Then, he had the game of his life. After falling behind by as much as 16, Mitchell knocked down four threes on five tries in a wild Seawolves comeback to beat the previously unbeaten Washington Huskies, the program’s first win against a nationally-ranked opponent.

“After I hit that first three I was like, ‘alright, got to keep getting them off because I feel pretty good right now,’” Mitchell said. The game seemed to insert even more life into Mitchell’s steady ascension, and he agrees.

“It definitely put confidence in my shot, that’s for sure. After that, I felt like I could get four, five shots up a game, start shooting more,” Mitchell said.

Prior to the Huskies game, Mitchell attempted .76 two-point field goals and .68 free throws per half. Following the Washington trip, those numbers jumped to 1.7 and .72 respectively.

“Pikiell told me he wanted me to be more aggressive,” Mitchell said. “He’s noticed in practice that I can score at the rim pretty well, so he gave me the green light to go ahead and try and do that whenever I can.”

And that three-point shot of his? Well, Mitchell is 12th among the nation’s sophomores who have attempted at least 35 threes this season in three-point percentage at 46.5 percent. All while trying to remain the squad’s best perimeter defender. “Felt like he was kind of hyping me up a little bit. I would love to be labeled that,” Mitchell said. “Every time I go on the court I want to guard the other team’s best offensive player and try to limit their success. I’m going to try and live up to it.”]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Stony Brook sports fans and those in the wrestling community may have noticed a lack of coverage, or even match results, for the Stony Brook club wrestling team.

According to the team’s coach, Alex Blank, the club-level squad ran into a season-altering roadblock, as the team recently lost regular access to a practice room and subsequently have not participated in any scheduled events since the Grapple at the Garden on Dec. 21.

“We had our practice space taken away,” Blank said. “Originally, we practiced in the athletic facilities building. Over winter break, we had been trying to get some practices in, since the Grapple at the Garden, and we went in one day and the mats were gone. Since then, we have had a lot of trouble reserving space in the rec center. We had struggled all season to be organized and it’s just another kind of blow to us.”

Blank said that the space was taken away due to unauthorized usage of the room by a mixed martial arts club. Although very understanding, Blank expressed disappointment towards the ensuing toll and hardship that has been placed on the team.

“The people at the athletic facilities were very kind in explaining and very open to explaining everything to us,” he said. “They said they had nothing against us, it’s just that kind of liability, they weren’t able to account for. I don’t understand why they had to do it when they did it, but it’s just the way it is. I understand how red tape works at the university level, but it has really taken a toll on our program.”

Since then, practices have been few and far between. The largest obstacle for the team lies within scheduling a practice that does not interfere with the varying school schedules of the student athletes.

“It’s been tough, I’m not gonna lie,” Blank said. “In order to compete at a club level and achieve your goals as a club, or a student athlete at the club level, there’s a lot of adversity that you need to face, both internally with organization and getting yourself motivated and finding the time to get the team together, and externally, which is your competition and still bettering yourself as a student-athlete.”

The team has missed all scheduled events since December, including the Nassau Open, NCWA National Duals, the Doug Cherry Invitational and a dual meet against Mount St. Vincent, originally scheduled for Feb. 5.

Blank made the decision not to participate in these events in an open forum with his team, with the result being that the wrestlers did not feel adequately prepared because they have had limited practice time in the last few months.

Despite all this, the club is still actively trying to make sure that their Feb. 21 match against Cortland, which will be held at Stony Brook University and serves as the only buffer between now and the NCWA Conference Championships, happens on schedule.

In fact, the Seawolves, according to Blank, are now also hosting SUNY Albany and Farmingdale State College. This will turn the Feb. 21 match into a quad meet.

“They just need to be out there to compete, just to get their feet wet again,” Blank said. “Get used to competing. Get used to being out there in front of a crowd. I’m desperately trying to make it happen.”

Even with this rough bout, the team remains optimistic. Blank commends the work, both physically and logistically, that his team has put in and remains confident for the future.

“My club president, Shaun Holliday, is really taking the bull by the horns as we close out the last part of the season,” he said. “He’s working very hard for me, as well as the rest of the executive board that I’m relying on. They’ve kind have been my eyes and ears when I’m not at the main campus.”

Aside from all of these problems, Blank and his team continues to persevere to be optimistic for the future.

“I hope for them to get as much out of this season as possible. I’m steering my expectations away from a quantitative sense. I just want them to get the most out of this experience, so that they can learn the lessons that the sport has to offer. They’ve put in the effort, the blood, the sweat, and the tears, so they have every right to reap the rewards they’re entitled to.”]]></content:encoded>

Amid the problems caused by the militant Islamist group Boko Haram in Nigeria, historian and Stony Brook University professor Shobana Shankar, Ph.D, has written an article for the London School of Economics and Political Science, outlining the parallels between the terrorist group Boko Haram and other marginalized groups in Northern Nigeria.

Although her expertise is not the analysis of Boko Haram, Shankar has studied on-site, living in Nigeria for several years studying the ways of the Nigerian people. She lived in an area separate from the area now dictated by Boko Haram.

Her interest in African culture began before college and she discovered her passion through studying abroad, which inspired her to learn about cultural interaction in Africa and other parts of the world while spotting parallels in how colonialism affected different regions. Her research has also looked at why people in different cultures view medicine in distinct ways.

Shankar interviewed hundreds of people during her time in Nigeria, specifically the elderly, who spoke about how different the country was when they were growing up.

Interested in seeing how different ethnic groups in the region treated one another and herself, Shankar made pluralism, or how two or more groups coexist, an important aspect of her research.

Boko Haram’s Arabic name, “Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad,” translates to “People Committed to the Propagation of the Prophet's Teachings and Jihad.” However, in Hausa, the language the people of the northeastern region of Maiduguri, Nigeria, “Boko Haram” loosely translates to “Western education is forbidden.”

Mohammed Yusuf founded the group in 2002 in order to oppose Western lifestyle. In 2009, the group began its creation of the Islamic State, and in the same year, its founder was killed by police officials.

Last spring, the group became well-known for the kidnapping of adolescent girls. On April 14, 2014, the group abducted 276 young women from Government Secondary School in Chibok, Nigeria. Fifty three of the girls have escaped successfully, some of which have returned to school in an act of defiance against the terrorist group.

“It is so much more about the past than the present,” Shankar said.

“One of the things to think about also is how the global community can think about engaging with people who live in societies affected by these kind of groups or situations, where they become isolated, where they shouldn’t be, because they have a lot to contribute to the global society,” she said. “They’re victimized in a broader sense by this group.”

Shankar, who is teaching a class on African politics and religion this semester (HIS 350), said that it is important to understand the deeper layers of history in order to really comprehend contemporary issues.

Shankar sees African history as an essential part of the history of the United States. Before the year 1800, the majority of migrants to the United States were African. Therefore, studying Africa, or other realms of history, can help students look at what they already know through a different lens.

“There is relevance for history to help understand what is happening now,” Shankar said.]]></content:encoded>

<i>Every other week, junior biology major Ruchi Shah will take a look at Stony Brook-related science and research news.</i>

36 questions in 45 minutes turn complete strangers into close friends or even a married couple. To most, this idea sounds unbelievable.

But the use of the 36 questions, carefully crafted by a team of scientists led by Arthur Aron, Ph.D., professor of psychology at Stony Brook University, have consistently resulted in the formation of close relationships in both the lab and in real-life settings.

“At the end of the 45 minutes, people feel almost as close to this person as the closest person in their life,” Aron said.

The key to the 36 questions is a gradual increase in the personal nature of the questions.

“We looked at research about how closeness spontaneously develops among friends,” Aron said. “We found the typical pattern is that you disclose personal info both ways and gradually increasing—that was the main thing we based it on.”

The questions are divided into three levels, with the first level being more superficial and the third level containing the most probing questions.

The goal in creating the questions, Aron explained, was to create feelings of closeness quickly by accelerating the process that people normally go through in forming relationships.

According to the research of Aron and other psychologists, it is important for people to feel that they have things in common with their partner in order to create a feeling of closeness.

“Having things in common is only moderately important, but thinking you have them in common matters a lot,” Aron said.

In order to facilitate the perception of commonality, a question in tier one is to name three things that the pair appears to have in common.

“Another thing that plays a huge role in developing friendships and closeness is feeling the other person likes you,” Aron said.

In tier two, the pair is prompted to “alternate sharing something you consider a positive characteristic of your partner. Share a total of
five items.”

The participants are further prompted to express why they like their partner in tier three with the questions, “Tell your partner what you like about them; be very honest this time, saying things that you might not say to someone you’ve just met,” and “Tell your partner something that you like about them already.”

The three main elements, the gradually increasing degree of the personal nature of the questions, the feeling of commonality and the feeling that each partner likes the other, are the reason why the questions are effective in forming close relationships.

Since the time when Aron and his team formed the questions, scientists have found data to suggest that a key to forming relationships is responsiveness. Therefore, the questions will only be effective in creating feelings of closeness if each partner actively responds to the other.

To test the effectiveness of the questions, Aron and his team implemented the questions into freshman seminar classes at Stony Brook University 10 years ago.

Not only did the questions foster close relationships, but those paired with a cross-race partner showed more positive attitudes towards the race of that partner, Aron said.

“If you have friend in another group, you are more likely to be more positive towards that group because in a way you are connected to them,” Aron said. “We have a theory that you include the other in yourself.”

Aron spoke about the possibility of using these questions to create friendship and ease social and racial tensions.

“We are going to not only publish the results, but we are going to put a free online website up that tells any university how they can do this with their incoming class, and I think it’s be a good thing for companies to use too,” Aron said.

His most recent research focuses on bringing together two dating couples who do not know the other couple to answer the 36 questions.

“We found that when two couples do this as a foursome, not only do they feel closer to the other couple, but they get closer to their own partner and it even increases passionate love,” Aron said.

When two couples of different races were brought together, there was an even bigger improvement in feeling towards the other group than when two individuals of different races were paired together.

“This is in part because it’s a more comfortable situation,” Aron said.  “You have the support of someone else, you have in common that you are both couples, so it’s easier to get closer than if its just two individuals.”

Aron is currently working to better understand how initial attraction between two people turns into a relationship.

“We know a huge amount of what makes for initial attraction between people and a huge amount about what makes for a good relationship, but we know almost nothing about how we go from initial attraction to being in a relationship,” Aron said. “It’s a really hard thing to study but its really important.”

MANJU SHIVACHARAN / THE STATESMAN[/caption]

The Undergraduate Student Government senate unanimously passed a new set of financial bylaws at its Thursday meeting by a vote of 18-0-2, adding and changing definitions used in budgets for campus clubs and organizations.

The new bylaws distinguish between “apparel” and “performance wear.” Whereas “apparel” is “any items of clothing, including but not limited to shirts,” performance wear is “any item of clothing worn specifically for performances, exhibitions, and demonstrations without intent of promotion.”

“A lot of clubs such as Deja Vu, Cadence, Pocket Theatre, etc. have a really hard time operating under the current laws for apparel,” said Treasurer Kathryn Michaud. “A lot of clubs will want t-shirts and stuff like that to promote their club, but some need actual uniforms and costumes to put on their shows.”

Each club and organization cannot spend more than $1000 or 10 percent of their USG budget, whichever is less, on apparel. The same rule applies for performance wear.

The new bylaws also redefine “regional event” by loosening the requirement for such events to be “sanctioned by an organization or other governing body not affiliated with any particular university and includes representatives from multiple schools from within a defined region.” The older, stricter requirements prevented certain groups from receiving grants to travel to national or regional events.

“Not every club is a part of an external body or something like that,” Michaud said. “An example is the performances with the dance groups. There isn’t an overall organization that host conferences or schedules or orients everything.”

Under the new bylaws, reimbursements will not require preapproval from the USG treasurer, but reimbursements that have not been preapproved are “subject to the discretion of the USG Treasurer and are not guaranteed to be processed.”

“A lot of clubs have run into issues where they went on an off-campus trip and they spent money for gas or something and they didn’t submit the forms or they didn’t get prior approval,” Michaud said.

Both Michaud and President Pro Tempore Cody Pomeroy said that clubs and organizations should not make a habit of not getting reimbursements preapproved.

“I guess it’s a trust issue, but in the future I don’t know if this is really the right way to go because it gives clubs an excuse to not have the paperwork in,” Pomeroy said.

“Nobody should expect to get reimbursed for something from a different organization if they don’t get prior approval for it,”
Michaud said.

The new bylaws also define food as “any item purchased for the purpose of consumption including beverages.”

The new bylaws also repeal the Contract Reform Act of 2011 and require that both the USG president and treasurer must sign contracts on the behalf of USG departments and agencies.

“There have been a couple of instances where a contract was signed off by the president and then the USG treasurer was not aware,” Michaud said. “So this way just ensures that the treasurer is aware of it and the president is aware of it."

Under the new bylaws, USG cannot enter contracts for more than one fiscal year without senate approval.

President Garry Lachhar asked if the rules on contracts would affect USG’s “eight-year contract with Ludacris.”

College of Arts and Sciences Sen. Nathan Blazon-Brown clarified that Lachhar’s inquiry was sarcasm.]]></content:encoded>

This year, the team consists of 13 members and one alternate. BASIL JOHN / THE STATESMAN[/caption]
<p class="p1">The Stony Brook dance team placed in the top five at the Universal Cheerleaders Association and Universal Dance Association College Cheerleading and Dance Team National Championships on Jan. 17 and 18 in Orlando, Fla.</p>
<p class="p1">“It was like the best experience of my entire life,” Regina Zambrano, team captain, said.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It has been a long journey for the dance team to get where it is today. </span></p>
<p class="p1">The National Championship<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>top-ranking team has completely evolved from where it was even just a few years ago.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Zambrano has been on the dance team since her freshman year. Now, as the only graduating senior on the team, she has watched the team transform. </span></p>
<p class="p1">“The growth we’ve had in three years is insane,” Zambrano said about the team.</p>
<p class="p1">She described the team she joined as a freshman as very different because it lacked a strict set of rules and it was more like a club than a team. The group did not have a coach. The team was run by the dancers themselves.</p>
<p class="p1">“The whole point of a dance team is that it’s supposed to be very uniform and we had like no uniformity to us,” she said.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">However, during Zambrano’s sophomore year, Sarah Harrington, came into the picture as the team’s coach. </span></p>
<p class="p1">Harrington has a background in coaching dance and was a dancer herself at the University of Tennessee, which has one of the top ranking dance teams in the nation. Zambrano said that when Harrington approached the team about being its coach, it seemed to be out be out of nowhere.</p>
<p class="p1">Harrington gave the team more structure and with her help the team was able to become more unified and skilled.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">“It completely changed my sophomore year and it’s only gone up since then,” Zambrano said about the change she saw in the team after Harrington took over as coach.</span></p>
<p class="p1">This change was able to drive the team to receive a top-ranking spot at this year’s National Championship. It was only the team’s second year attending.</p>
<p class="p1">When the team first went to the National Championships in 2014, Zambrano said that she was shocked that the team was in the Division I category.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Both Zambrano and Harrington stated that the first year going to Nationals was treated as a learning experience.</span></p>
<p class="p1">The team did not make it to the finals that year. The team came close to making the finals in pom and finished in the top 20 for jazz.</p>
<p class="p1">In order to improve for this year the team changed training habits and its technique.</p>
<p class="p1">Zambrano said that the team overtrained the previous year and by the time the competition came, the Seawolves<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>were burnt out.</p>
<p class="p1">“Coming into nationals this year we really set our sights high and the whole team has pushed each other,” Harrington said.</p>
<p class="p1">This year to prepare for the National Championship, the team hired two different choreographers from out of state. Zambrano said that it cost the team a lot of money, but it was worth it.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">The first time the team attempted to go to Nationals it did not use choreographers, this year it seemed to have paid off. The team also practiced every day from December to January from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. </span></p>
<p class="p1">“National season is eat, sleep, breathe dance,” Zambrano said.</p>
<p class="p1">The team came in the top five for its pom routine and did not place for<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>its jazz routine.</p>
<p class="p1">Zambrano said that the jazz category is very difficult. However, she described how the crowd was going crazy for the girls<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>while they performed their pom routine.</p>
<p class="p1">Harrington said that the way the team prepared was by working on technique and putting in extra hours and never settling.</p>
<p class="p1">“It was hard, but it was worth it because obviously it paid off and we came really far,” Vincenza Bartolillo, a freshman biology major and pre-med student said. “Hopefully next year we can improve even more.”</p>
<p class="p1">Zambrano gave a lot of the credit for doing so well at Nationals to Harrington. She described a closeness that the team all shares with her that Zambrano will miss next year after she graduates.</p>
<p class="p1">“I have been blessed to have absolutely fantastic leaders on this team,” Harrington said. “I have a fantastic group of dancers every single year that really work hard and they trust me to lead them in the right direction.”</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">The dance team raises all of its money on its own because it is not under Stony Brook Athletics, it is considered a club and is funded by the Undergraduate Student Government. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">Although USG supplies them with money, it is not enough to support the team and the group fundraises often in order to afford its uniforms and to pay their coaches. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Harrington said that the team’s dedication is the biggest key to its success. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">“They really do want to be ambassadors for the university and put a great show on the floor no matter where they are,” Harrington said. </span></p>
<p class="p1">Zambrano said that her hope for the future of the team is to one day be able to watch the UDA National Championships on her computer and have Stony Brook be the No. 1 Division I school.</p>
<p class="p1">“I’m leaving off comfortable now because I kind of like, helped everyone know what to do. It’s a good feeling,” Zambrano said. She also described how happy she was to have done so well at her last competition ever.</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s just been a part of me, like Stony Brook wouldn’t have been Stony Brook without [the] dance team,” she said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

BASIL JOHN / THE STATESMAN[/caption]

On Wednesday, Feb. 11, the Seawolves will take on the UMBC Retrievers back home in Island Federal Credit Union Arena at 7 p.m. after a two-game road trip.  They will also look to extend their current win streak to three.

Stony Brook is coming off of a pair of victories against Vermont and New Hampshire.  The team is 6-4 in conference play and 13-10 overall and are fourth in the America East.  UMBC is not playing as well this season and is 3-7 in conference play, which is good for seventh in the America East, and have an overall record of 8-15.

In their first meeting of the season, the Seawolves had a strong second-half performance that allowed them to take a 66-50 win over the Retrievers. Senior forward Sabre Proctor had a double-double with 20 points and 10 rebounds. Junior forward Brittany Snow and sophomore guard Kori Bayne-Walker dropped 16 points apiece in the contest. Bayne-Walker and Proctor will have to continue their great play against UMBC, especially after they scored 23 each in their last game, the win against Vermont.

If the Seawolves want to come out with a win, they are going to need to continue to attack the paint against UMBC. In their last match up, the Seawolves outscored the Retrievers 36-20 in the paint. Another key for the Seawolves will be knocking down the three ball, and a big part of the team's deep attack will be sophomore guard Christa Scognamiglio. After her first start in New Hampshire on Feb. 1, Scognamiglio has been averaging 15 points a game and shooting an incredible 63.6 percent from downtown.

UMBC will need another huge game from sophomore guard Taylor McCarley if it wants the win. After her 29 point game against New Hampshire, you can bet McCarley will be a huge factor this Wednesday.  The Retrievers will also need to get to the line, and after her school record-setting 17 free throws against New Hampshire, they will be looking at McCarley once again.  They will also look at junior guard Capree Garner to help pick up the slack on offense.

The Seawolves have been dominant at home, going 8-3. UMBC has struggled away from home, going 4-8. Stony Brook leads the all-time series, 14-12.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_34781" align="alignleft" width="600"]<a href="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/untitled-3.jpg"><img class="wp-image-34781 size-medium" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/untitled-3-600x400.jpg" alt="ANDREW EICHENHOLZ / THE STATESMAN" width="600" height="400" /></a> Stony Brook maintained a 23-9 record last year, but is now at a disappointing 15-10 after the team's loss to the Vermont Catamounts. ANDREW EICHENHOLZ / THE STATESMAN[/caption]

After a crushing loss to Vermont at home on Saturday, the Seawolves men’s basketball team (15-10, 6-4) looks to rebound this week with two winnable conference matchups.

The first of those will come Wednesday night against the UMBC Retrievers (3-20, 1-9) at 7 p.m. from the Retriever Activities Center in Baltimore, Md.

It is safe to say that the first contest of the week is fairly vital to the Seawolves recovering some of the momentum they have lost after dropping their past two games.

Leading the way for the Retrievers is senior guard Wayne Sparrow, who is averaging 13.6 points per game but is shooting barely over only 36 percent from the field.  Sparrow scored a game-high 17 points back on Jan. 14, when these teams met last.

Drawing the matchup of Jameel Warney will more than likely be forward Cody Joyce.  He is the Retrievers’ second-leading scorer, who produced his averages of 13 points and five rebounds in his last game against the Seawolves.

For Warney, he will be looking to duplicate his performance from nearly four weeks ago.  His nine points, 11 rebounds and eight assists were the closest he has been to a triple-double in conference play this season.

On Saturday afternoon at 2 p.m. at the Island Federal Credit Union Arena, the Seawolves will look to fire Cupid’s arrow straight through the hearts of the Maine Black Bears (3-21, 2-9).

The Saturday matinee features a matchup between the nation’s better rebounding clubs in Stony Brook against one of the nation’s worst, Maine.  The Seawolves are ripping down an average of 39.4 rebounds per game, which is good for 17th best in the nation.  On the other hand, the Black Bears are snagging just 29.3, which is 339th out of the 351 Division I teams in the country.

These two last met back on Jan. 17 from Bangor, Maine, and Carson Puriefoy led the scoring column with 18 points.  Puriefoy is just six three-pointers away from tying his mark of 39 made threes from 2013-14, but his percentage has plummeted down to 29 percent from 43 last year.

Kevin Little, the leading scorer for the Black Bears, is a Wyandanch, N.Y. product.  The freshman also happens to be Maine’s leading scorer with an average of 11.8 points per game.  Part of the reason the Seawolves cruised to a 43-point victory nearly a month ago was due to Little’s 0-for-5 shooting night, which produced zero points and five turnovers.]]></content:encoded>

Over the weekend, the Seawolves manhandled the Scarlet Ice Knights of Rutgers en route to a guaranteed playoff berth at the ACHA National Tournament.

The domination began Friday night, which also doubled as Alumni Night. In front of a sea of Stony Brook faithful, the Seawolves dispatched of the visiting Scarlet Ice Knights by a final of 12-0.

Forward Bobby Guidal led the scoring charge with a hat trick, while goalie Derek Willms held steadfast, blocking all 24 Rutgers shots, leading to the Seawolves’ first shutout since Dec. 6 against Delaware.

“[Guidal] was in the right spot at the right time all night,” said Stony Brook head man Chris Garofolo. It did not take very long for another shutout to happen—24 hours, in fact.

This time around, it was sophomore goalie Todd Scarola who stood on his head as the Seawolves once again cruised to victory, this time by a final of 8-0.

It was not just the netminders who displayed their depth, but in the absence of senior forward Sam Brewster and senior defenseman Chris Joseph, who are both away with Team USA in the Winter World University Games, the five out in front of the goaltenders stepped up in a major way.

“It is an opportunity for players to come in and play and they’re capitalizing on their opportunities,” Garofalo said about his team.

The last time these two teams met back on Oct. 17 and 18, the Seawolves cruised to a 13-1 victory, before scratching out a 5-3 victory. For the year, they finished up with a 4-0 record against Rutgers and outscored them 38-4 in those matchups.

A big part of the success this season has been the balance as well as the depth of this team. “I’d rather have seven guys with 20 points than two guys with 50 and then the rest with 10,” Garofolo said.

The Seawolves have six players with 20 points or more on the season, with Vincent Lopes leading the way with 46 points, tallying 22 goals and 24 assists on the year. Nick Barbera is tied for the team lead with the same number of assists.

The Seawolves finish up their regular season next weekend at home, as, they welcome in the Lebanon Valley College Flying Dutchmen, who are third in the ESCHL with 32 points. Faceoff on Saturday night at The Rinx in Hauppauge is scheduled for 8:30 p.m., while Sunday’s regular-season finale is slated for 3:30 p.m.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_35006" align="alignleft" width="600"]<a href="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Cute-Bear-by-Megan-Miller.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-35006" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Cute-Bear-by-Megan-Miller-600x421.jpg" alt="MEGAN MILLER / THE STATESMAN" width="600" height="421" /></a> Valentine's Day is not just about being in a relationship, it is about spending time with ones you love and care about. MEGAN MILLER / THE STATESMAN[/caption]

Singles, it is time to hunker down and buckle up because Valentine’s Day is fast-approaching. This means Single’s Awareness Day or S.A.D. is also around the corner. But do not panic. Your survival guide to all things Valentine is right here.
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Around this time, a mix of decorations, social media posts and the occasional nag from your grandmother pull at your heart and remind what you are missing in your love life. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This can cause a lot of stress and unhappiness for the single person just trying to make it through the holiday and reach the discount chocolates that await them on the other side.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“People who are not in a relationship, there is some pressure on them because there’s a kind of cultural-societal expectation, implied by Valentine’s Day, that you should be in a relationship,” Norman Goodman, Ph.D., a sociology professor, explained.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This pressure can really start to bring you down but here are some suggestions to help you push back and pull through. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Dare yourself to be bold.</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Step one, try not to be single on Valentine’s Day. Step two, repeat step one,” Jason Loprete, a freshman<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>mechanical engineering and applied mathematics and statistics major, instructed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If what you want is to have a Valentine of your very own just go out and find one. It may be time to find an excuse to talk to that crush you have been eyeing in class. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is no crush? No problem. The world is full of great people that you just do not know yet. It only takes a two seconds of courage to find this year’s Valentine. If that does go over well, move on to the next. You have nothing to lose because you are already single.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b>Get together with loved ones.</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Valentine’s Day does not have to be all about finding a significant other. There are other significant people around you that you can spend the day with.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Have a game night with single friends and family. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Make up your own Valentine’s Day games and see who can get the most creative. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you want to play Cupid for a day, have a party and instruct every single friend to bring another single. Cupid pairs guests for a night of awkward fun (arrows are not suggested).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Focus on you. </b> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Food, candy, Netflix and your favorite pajamas are all the ingredients for the perfect date with...yourself. After all, who else could pick out all of your favorite things? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With people worrying about what color roses to buy and whether or not their significant other is allergic to nuts, you will have the perfect opportunity to be with the person who knows you best. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Be sure to stay positive.</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">While this holiday may not be your favorite, it is important to keep in mind that it is only one day out of the year. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Do not torture yourself with the endless news feeds on social media. The last thing any single person wants to see on Valentine’s Day is an Instagram post with the biggest candle-lit teddy bear ever created holding a bouquet of roses. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">“It’s the social media that annoys me. People go to the extreme and post about Valentine’s Day every five seconds,” Danny Smith, a sophomore linguistics major, said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Stony Brook, are you ready to fall in love?</em>

After our <a href="http://sbstatesman.com/tag/under-the-microscope/">Under the Microscope</a> columnist <a href="http://sbstatesman.com/author/rshah/">Ruchi Shah</a> spoke to Arthur Aron, Ph.D., about his <a href="http://sbstatesman.com/2015/02/09/under-the-microscope-36-questions-shown-to-form-closer-relationships/">findings</a>, <em>The Statesman</em> editors have decided that we wanted to try the 36 Questions experiment for ourselves. Aron said the experiment will definitely create close bonds between the participants but we want to see if Stony Brook students are willing to take it a step further. <strong>We are looking for students who are interested in opening up about themselves and participating in this project.</strong>

Using the information you provide in the survey below, we will use a random match generator to pair you up with another student. Then, we will ask you to come down to our office (Room 057 in the Union Basement) to do the experiment. After that, it is up to you. The survey will close on <strong>Feb. 11 at 10 p.m</strong>. All spam answers will be removed. <strong>You must fill out this survey to participate.</strong>

Interested? Have questions or concerns? Shoot us an email at <a href="mailto:36questions@sbstatesman.com">36questions@sbstatesman.com</a> and we will get back to you as soon as possible.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_35109" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-35109 size-medium" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/marriagephoto1_heather.khalifa-600x400.jpg" alt="marriagephoto1_heather.khalifa" width="600" height="400" /> The Pew Research Center reported that in 2012, one-in-five adults ages 25 and older had never been married, totalling about 42 million people. Conversely, in 1960, only one-in-ten adults in the same age group, about nine percent of adults, had never been married. <em>HEATHER KHALIFA / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">T</span><span class="s1">oday, the average</span> adult is holding off on saying, “I do.” For some adults, it might be forever. Others are just waiting.</p>
<p class="p3">“I think this reflects very well on our hookup culture,” Nathan Blazon-Brown, a sophomore biochemistry major at Stony Brook University, said. “A lot of people are floating around, not looking for a committed relationship. There are some people I do see looking for a relationship, but for the most, part I think people are looking for that casual hookup.”</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">New research by the Pew Research Center revealed the average age to get married is 27 for women and 29 for men. In the 1960s, the average age to get married was 20 for women and 23 for men.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">“The increasing age of partners at the incidence of marriage is probably a result of the changed status of women, which gathered steam in the 1960s,” Norman Goodman, a sociology professor at SBU, said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“As women became more equal, more women increased their educational level and also entered the workforce, two factors that made them less dependent on marriage for financial support and more willing and able to delay marriage.”</span></p>
<p class="p3">College students keep stressing the same thing when it comes to marriage: they want to be financially secure before they tie the knot.</p>
<p class="p3">“I think it is better for people to wait until they are financially secure to get married because more often, people have loans from college to pay off in addition to saving money for a wedding,” Megan Pantaleo, a senior marine vertebrate biology major, said. “Also I think it is better to start off a marriage with both parties on good financial terms.”</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Students and professors across Stony Brook’s campus agree college is a great place for young adults to meet a significant other who shares similar interests and goals.</span></p>
<p class="p3">In addition, both parties agree there is less of a focus on a “Mrs. Degree,” a term used to describe females who go to college just to find a husband.</p>

<p class="p3">“My general impression is that compared with about 50 to 60 years ago, college is less about getting a Mrs. than a BA/BS,” Goodman said. “Also, the greater sexual freedom afforded in college, especially residential colleges, to experiment with relationships allows considerable freedom and flexibility in finding the right significant other.”</p>
<p class="p3">Similarly, the percentage of people who have never been married is also growing.</p>
<p class="p3">The Pew Research Center reported that in 2012, one-in-five adults ages 25 and older had never been married, totalling about 42 million people. Conversely, in 1960, only one-in-ten adults in the same age group, about nine percent of adults, had never been married.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">“I think that society is putting less emphasis on marriage so much that it is, or will be soon, no longer the norm to get married then have children,” Pantaleo said.</span></p>
<p class="p3">The analysis also states that out of the never-married adults, almost half of them would like to be married eventually.</p>
<p class="p3">Psychology professor Daniel O’Leary compared this to how young adults at Stony Brook feel about getting married in general.</p>
<p class="p3">“I think it’s just like the younger people here at Stony Brook,” O’Leary said. “The vast majority of my students say yes to wanting to be married even if the statistics say that almost 50 percent of marriages end in divorce.”</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Still, there is a group of people who will never walk down the aisle.</span></p>
<p class="p3">“Nearly half of the population is getting divorced and then there is a large segment of the population that has kids, but never marries,” O’Leary said. “It’s not like the 1950s anymore where people had two kids, a dog and a jeep. We just aren’t there anymore.”</p>
<p class="p3">While being in a relationship where the couple raises a family and never marries is seen as a more modern thing in America, this is socially normal in other parts of the world.</p>
<p class="p3">“In Europe and Canada, you have large segments of the population that don’t marry at all,” O’Leary said. “They live together, have children, but just don’t get married. It seems to be a social thing.”</p>
<p class="p3">Today more and more people in America have the mentality of “why marry just because we have a kid,” according to O’Leary.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">In 2010, O’Leary and two others at SBU published a study about premarital cohabitation and the effects of living together on couples in the Journal of Marriage and the Family.</span></p>
<p class="p3">The studies found that those who lived together but did not get married were more likely to separate. However, those who were engaged and lived together were just as likely to have a successful of relationships as those who were married.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">“The answer as to what those figures say about our society and our value of marriage is complicated,” Goodman said. “I am a romantic who still sees value in getting married. For one, it is an indication of a stronger level of commitment to your partner and the relationship than for those who are cohabiting or are involved in a series of hookups.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">But whether these trends continue or not, students and professors agree there is no such thing as a traditional family or relationship anymore. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">“Everyone is different and every relationship is different, so you don’t necessarily have to follow the statistics,” Blazon-Brown said. “I am still dating the same girl from high school and that’s not statistically normal, but it works for us.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Dakota Jordan: “She knows about everything”</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_35127" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-35127 size-medium" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Heather.Khalifa_sexissue_11.30.15_6-600x400.jpg" alt="Heather.Khalifa_sexissue_11.30.15_6" width="600" height="400" /> Dakota Jordan, above, a studio art major, is president of The Next Generation (TNG) club that promotes sexual positivity, relationship consent and alternative approaches to intimacy. <em>THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">T</span><span class="s2">he Stony Brook</span> <span class="s4">Student Union Starbucks is loud.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Dakota Jordan is louder.</span></p>
<p class="p3">She lifts her shirt to reveal a long, vertical scar that extends up her torso, evidence of a time she almost internally bled to death when she was six years old. She had decided to ride an adult bike downhill when she hit a rock, and the impact launched her stomach against the handlebars. She flipped forward and crumpled to the ground. Consequently, she lost her spleen.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s5">“When people bleed to death in movies, it’s like a slow, gentle thing,” Jordan said. “That’s not what bleeding to death is like. You experience death on a cellular level.” </span></p>
<p class="p3">Jordan no longer rides bikes. She does, however, have a self-inflicted inverted cross on her forearm composed entirely of small, round scars caused by the tip of a lit cigarette.</p>
<p class="p3">“I like things that hurt, because I love the feeling of acknowledging that my body isn’t made of glass,” Jordan said. “That’s such a powerful feeling.”</p>
<p class="p3">She also has a penchant for lecturing, which she admits without notable reluctance.</p>
<p class="p3">Jordan can lecture about safely being lit on fire. She can lecture about autonomy or the unjust expectations of marriage. She can lecture about polyamory, ageplay, knife play, rape fantasies and amputation fetishes. She can lecture about commitment. Or why she has been engaged four times in her short 22 years of life.</p>
She can talk about her strong aversion to children. About the time she made a documentary of her menstruation, just because she was asked. About the distinct differences between correlation and causation.
<p class="p3">Regardless of the lecture content, so long as there is someone listening, Jordan will be heard.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s6">“I talk at people,” she said matter-of-factly. “Not with people.”</span></p>
<p class="p3">Jordan’s tendency to impart her knowledge of varying subject comes, she said, from a time when she was very young.</p>
<p class="p3">Her family “kind of treated me like a mini-adult,” she said. “That’s probably why I’m hyper-nerdy. They would be like ‘I don’t know. Give her a book. Do something. She’s bored.’”</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s6">She also learned to be independent. Having had Jordan when they were in high school, her parents never married. She was raised in Holbrook, N.Y., where she shared a three-bedroom apartment with a constant influx of rotating family members</span>, the constants being Jordan’s mother and grandmother, occasionally her great-grandmother, and her two aunts who, in-between jobs or relationships, would sleep beside her mother in the master bedroom.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s6">According to Jordan, there were never any men. She would see her father a few times a month.</span></p>
<p class="p3">“All of my friends had absentee dads, divorced dads,” she said. “It just seemed very normal.”</p>
<p class="p3">Presently, however, Jordan maintains two relationships: one with her new husband, Michael Jordan, and the other with her long-distance boyfriend, Robert Charde, affectionately referred to as J.B., or “jail bait.”</p>
This past September, Jordan decided to marry Michael, mainly for monetary purposes, who she has been with for several years. Jordan was the first woman Michael had ever intimately dated. When Jordan and Michael began seeing each other, however, she was already engaged to another man.
<p class="p3"><span class="s6">“I say I always need to have two partners because I need to be the focus of everybody’s universe,” she said, smirking. “One person could not provide the attention.”</span></p>
<p class="p3">When asked the reason why Michael was okay with her relationship continuing with Charde, Jordan responded, “We spend a lot of time together. We have a lot of sex. I guess he just doesn’t see how my relationship with somebody else takes away anything from him.”</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s4">The Stony Brook Student Union’s Fireside Lounge is loud. Jordan is still louder. Joining her are members of the club she heads, SBU’s The Next Generation (TNG), a group dedicated to promoting sexual positivity, relationship consent and providing a safe space for those who choose alternative approaches to intimacy.</span></p>
<p class="p3">For approximately the next hour, they proceed to debate about feminist theories. They discuss the benefit gender-inclusive dormitories provide for individuals’ whose gender identity differs from their biological sex. Jordan expresses her disgust for “gooey” human pornography (or all the bodily fluids that result from having raucous sex), arguing instead for Japanese anime, which spares the viewer such conspicuous details. There is a short dispute about the existence of
a sexualized Wolfie.</p>
<p class="p3">And then, she remembers that time with the candy cane dildo.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s4">The graphic recount of Jordan’s escapade with the phallic holiday staple is punctuated by the presentation of a picture, pulled from the club’s Facebook page, of Jordan in the middle of a well-lit living room, sporting a clingy, black, strapless romper and knee high boots. She towers over her Jewish male “friend” who is bound to a chair with garland and Christmas lights, wearing nothing but red underwear and a Santa hat.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The photograph reads, “Happy holidays from SBU TNG.” </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s4">Formerly a double major in English and history until she decided to change to studio art, a concentration she regards as time-consuming, Jordan still manages to balance being TNG’s president and head of public relations for the university’s Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance.</span></p>
<p class="p3">“She knows about everything,” Tristan Catalano, the treasurer of TNG, said.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Among those responsibilities, she also writes the monthly sex column for the Stony Brook Press, titled “Ask A Semi Professional Pervert,” where she encourages readers to email and tweet her any of their sexual inquiries. The cadence of her voice, sardonic, deliberate and palpable, can be heard distinctly through her written answers. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">“Try not to dwell on a silly value system that makes people feel bad about humping,” Jordan responded to an 18-year-old reader, torn over how to adequately pleasure her boyfriend without losing her virginity. “Bunnies hump all the time and we still love them.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_35118" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-35118 size-medium" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Heather.Khalifa_SexIssue_SBUsecrets-600x400.jpg" alt="Heather.Khalifa_SexIssue_SBUsecrets" width="600" height="400" /> Stony Brook Admirers 2 is a Facebook page devoted to anonymously allowing SBU students to confess secret admiration for a campus love interest. <em>STATESMAN STOCK PHOTO</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1">H<span class="s1">andwritten notes are </span>no longer the way to confess your love. Secret admirers instead utilize Stony Brook Admirers 2, a Facebook page with over 4,000 likes and just over 4,000 posts.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">There are two ways to submit a post to Stony Brook Admirers 2. The first way is to send the post directly to the inbox on the SBA 2’s Facebook page. The other is to send a post anonymously through the page’s
Tumblr account. </span></p>
<p class="p3">“I love knowing that people have feelings for others and they go out of their way to let the world know (even if the post is anonymous they still attempted),” one of two administrators of the page, who chose to remain anonymous, said via Facebook.</p>
<p class="p3">The page administrators claim they receive anywhere from 30 to 40 posts per day. On a particularly active week, they may have over 200 posts, with fluctuations during test weeks.</p>
<p class="p3">“The most interesting thing about running this page is seeing what some people submit,” the previously mentioned administrator said. “The fact that they went out of their way to give someone a sweet message, ‘like hey, I think you are cute, keep it up’ just makes my day.’”</p>
<p class="p3">The page is under new management since its inception, therefore the original intention for the page is unknown. But the new managers have their own ideas.</p>
<p class="p3">“I feel like the page was inspired by the fact that many of us fall in love or find someone we fancy, yet we cannot build the confidence to approach them,” one of the administrators said. “Posting on here helps people let their crush know there is someone out there interested in them of the page.”</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The administrators receive feedback from a handful of people giving their thanks to the page because it gave them an outlet to tell the person they liked how they felt. </span></p>
<p class="p3">Oftentimes, the administrators will read through some out-of-the-ordinary posts.</p>
<p class="p3">“From time to time, I will get strange posts, where they dream about doing the weirdest things to the person, or having things done to them,” said one of the administrators of the page. “I think those are funny, but some of the details people put in are crazy and they use so much imagery.”</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Those who are frequent viewers of the page might notice some of the same names popping up now and again. But to the people who are being posted about, it sometimes comes off as a joke. </span></p>
<p class="p3">“Most of the time, I’m pretty sure my friends are just making fun of me (one friend in particular whose name I won’t mention), but there are a few genuine posts that are pretty darn cute, and of course I’m extremely flattered by them,” junior biochemistry major Ashwin Kelkar said via Facebook.</p>
<p class="p3">In other instances, although flattering, it can be odd to respond to an anonymous post. Sophomore biology major Diana Rubel has experienced this.</p>
<p class="p3">“When someone posts about me, I always feel very flattered, but sometimes a little awkward,” Rubel said via Facebook. “For example, I had someone ask me to be their girlfriend over Stony Brook Admirers and while it was sweet, I was a little taken back by being asked out anonymously.”</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s4">Although she may have her fair share of admirers on the page, she believes it is a good medium to show appreciation of someone. </span></p>
<p class="p3">This understanding has made Rubel give a piece of her own advice to admirers.</p>
<p class="p3">“As for the people who post to the page anonymously, I encourage you to tell the person you admire face to face,” Rubel said. “You’ll never know if they like you back if you remain anonymous forever.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

Getting a present that someone is excited to give you is much more enjoyable. This works the same way." <em>THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1">I <span class="s1">am not sure what</span> <span class="s2">adventurous person first had the idea of putting someone else’s genitalia in their mouth, but I for one believe this person deserves a very large muffin basket. This person’s clear disregard for sanitation and the potential for pink eye has served the world’s community in a manner paralleled only by the invention of the wheel.  It is like an arousing massage for your genitals.  For those of you who are not even sure how to pronounce the word fellatio (fel-A-sheo) let alone perform it, please continue reading.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">1. Just as they tell runners and women in labor, do not forget to breathe. There is usually a lot to pay attention to south of the border, and you need to master when to take a breath in order to be able to run the whole 5k.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When it comes to actually taking that breath through your nose, use some common sense.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do you really want to do that as close as possible to something that has been trapped between a pair of sweaty thighs for the last eight hours? Probably not.

And after a few weeks or so of this blissful crush stage, you will begin to wonder: is this something more? Because you know you are not just friends. You can not just be friends, there is no way." <em>THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

The almost relationship; it is a hard concept to explain. “Oh no we didn’t date but we almost-but-not-technically-officially had something.” I mean on paper it does sound kind of strange. How can you almost date someone? How do you get that close and not cross the line?

Even if you never officially date the person, you still were something with that person. Even if you could not define it and no label was slapped on it and sealed up all nice and pretty, something was there. And that is why almost relationships are the absolute most annoying type of relationship: you will always only get so close to the good part before it all comes crashing down.

These kinds of relationships are hard to understand and even harder to define, but we all know what an almost relationship is. It is when you text all the time, sometimes about nothing but also about the deep stuff. You meet up for pizza every Monday after class. You have inside jokes. When you are walking together, sometimes they nudge you with their shoulder, or make a stupid comment and wink. They will tousle your hair because they know you hate it and then run away laughing because they know you’ll chase them.

It is a flirty friendship, even if you are hoping for more. And after a few weeks or so of this blissful crush stage, you will begin to wonder: is this something more? Because you know you are not just friends. You can not just be friends, there is no way. Who tickles you while studying and wants to “just be friends?” Who texts you at 4 a.m. to talk about their fears and is not interested in something more?

But the sad truth is, most of the time, they are not looking for something more. And that is where the “almost” part of the relationship comes in. It was not a straight “yes,” but you were not rejected either. You know you were not the only one putting effort into this relationship because they relied on you too. And, very importantly, there were definitely moments. Moments when you were walking them back to their dorm late at night and when it is time to say goodbye, there is this strange tension. Like something more should be there, but it is not. And we tell ourselves that they have to feel this tension too. How can they not when you are standing there with a thousand thoughts racing through your head a mile a minute?

The next thing you know, they are gone. Almost relationships end just like they begin: with no real explanation. You are walking to class one day and see them holding hands with someone. They do it so casually too, like it is a normal thing to just go around holding hands with people when you know you two had something.

As it turns out, that something we felt was really us just eager to give our hearts away. And while it seems unfair, the person may never have actually asked for our hearts, but we were just ready to hand them over on a silver platter. But that does not mean you made up all the things that happened before. What about the pizza dates? The flirty poking? The late-night talks?

This is why almost-relationships leave you feeling robbed. Because even if nothing actually formed, it does not mean there were no expectations.

But our expectations do not always mirror the reality of the situation; we just hope that they do. We were given an inch and we took a mile. All while anticipating that going the whole mile for this person was exactly what they had in mind, we never even bothered to ask the person directly if becoming something more was what they wanted. We just assumed it was. Which leaves you even more annoyed because not only did you not date the person, but you did not date them and still managed to get your heart broken.

In the end, every person should, and probably will, go through an almost-relationship. They teach us a lot about relationships, even if we do not notice it at the time. Almost-relationships never leave the harbor of “just friends” because we were too scared to shy or say the words and mess things up. But we should say the words. We should be brave and daring when we date, not constantly wondering what someone is thinking and when or even if things are going to someday be something.

In the words of Mark Sloan, “If you love someone, you tell them. Even if you’re scared that it’s not the right thing. Even if you’re scared that it’ll cause problems. Even if you’re scared that it will burn your life to the ground, you say it, and you say it loud and go from there.”]]></content:encoded>

There is something about 2 a.m..

Let me set the mood. Your friends have gone home, an empty wine glass stands testament to what is in your system. You’re sitting alone on the couch or in bed, Netflix playing in the background, phone in hand. The messages come flooding in.

Pick your poison: Tinder, Grindr, OKCupid, Facebook even, for the desperately old fashioned.

“Hey, how’s it going tonight?” We all play stupid and respond, as if by chance someone is genuinely curious as to what would be doing in the middle of the night on a weekday. A message back and hopefully, courtship begins. Everyone involved in the conversation knows what is going on, but does not say it, not at first. Love, or at the very least sex, is a game. A game we have all become well conditioned in our pubescent years to play. If matchmaking and love were as simple as digital code, the message would just read, “I like your face, come over and touch my genitals,” or “Come over for some heavy petting clumsily disguised as cuddling.”

There’s nothing wrong with this. Most people like the chase. Messaging at 2 a.m. just invites all sorts of assumptions. The glaring one that nobody explicitly says or mentions is that someone on their preferred dating app so early in the morning is either horny or lonely. It’s mostly true, and I know too well that cringe-inducing mistakes and long-lasting love can be found at 2 a.m..

Now let’s switch the tables. The sun was over China in this last scenario, how about when it is right above us, banishing the dark shroud of liquid courage and artificial light that makes us so chatty and personable. How about we make it 2 p.m.?

You message the person you were talking to last night. You thought you guys hit it off, and you have time in between classes for a quick bite or coffee break. How about you guys meet up and talk? No pressure, just to get to know each other a little better. Beyond the digital realm.

You check your phone five, ten minutes later. No response.

A message comes later that night. “Hey, sorry about earlier, my phone died in class.” There’s a litany of excuses that come up in this situation, but they all lead to the same conclusion. This person is much more social when the sun goes down.

Why is it that we have become much more comfortable talking to someone online at 2 a.m. rather than over lunch at 2 p.m.? I think a lot of my contemporaries would blame the “hookup culture” of today’s youth, though I tend to think of that as a term millennials themselves have procured in moments of self-disgust. One-night stands have always existed in one form or another. It is just less psychologically damaging to think that our parents or grandparents in college were not as carefree with their sexuality as we are now. I assure you it was not so. As technology has done in all areas of our lives, it has just expedited the process. We can now instead of sweeping a room full of sexually-frustrated faces at a party, simply swipe left or right to those faces we find superficially attractive. This sounds negative, but let us not pretend it was not superficial for the generations before us. My point is that, in layman’s terms, these apps have just helped us find people to screw much quicker.

I believe there is a bigger underlying problem here, a mentality that permeates not only our love lives, but the lives of the under-30s in general. Every decision we make has immediate consequences that will lead to future consequences that go on forever. An infinite anxiety loop. We see it in people with test-taking anxiety. If I do not understand this question, I will fail this test, I will fail this class, that will lower my GPA so I can not get into the School of Business, which means I won’t be able to get the job I need to pay off these student loans, so therefore this single question decides my future homelessness.

It would be easy to explain if I were able to understand the root of this mentality in ourselves, but alas, I can’t. We just exist as very dramatic people. In this way, a simple meeting for lunch becomes what one is afraid to define as a “date.” If we meet for lunch, it is a date. If we go on a date, we are dating. I don’t even know you. I just met you in Tinder last night.

That is the paranoia. In much the same way that people struggle with relationship statuses. If you’re in a relationship that does not look straight down the line to the altar, we think, what’s the point?

Since the beginning of time, courtship is a way of seeing how things work out. We have progressed beyond the age of arranged marriages, at least in America. We can have fun meeting people, screwing people and not thinking so far into the future. We live in a time where people try their hardest to shy away from definitions and labels, while all the more feeling confused in their own relationships. Do not be afraid to get to know someone, love someone and hurt someone. There will be plenty more people to know, love and hurt in the future. That does not mean you have to throw every caution to the wind, playing or maneating your way to love, but it also does not mean minor commitments lead to trouble. Let us spend less time worrying about definitions or consequences, and more time on what we want. If you like someone, let them know it. Even if it is at 2 a.m..]]></content:encoded>

And slowly you seem to be losing ownership of everything that was once yours." <em>THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

Relationships: Everybody seems to want one…until they are actually in one. It is only when you are in the thick of things when you begin to realize that maybe giving up your lonely Saturday night Netflix binges with a bottle of wine and bag of Cheetos was not your smartest decision. But what leads to these dreaded breakups? Here are ten reasons:

1. Annoying habits: These are nothing at first. The way they audibly chew their food or nervously crack their knuckles. It is tolerable at first, maybe even cute, until suddenly it is not. Now, it is the only thing you focus on when you look at them. How can you focus on answering how your day was when that was the 23rd time he has cleared his throat in two minutes?

2. Overly clingy: You have been dating for a week and he has already booked the building for the wedding reception. You love getting the good morning texts, but maybe not a 24-hour bombardment of kissy-face emojis. And slowly you seem to be losing ownership of everything that was once yours. It is not your dorm room, it is our dorm room. It is not your toothbrush, it is our toothbrush.

3. Actively listens to Justin Bieber or Nickelback: They are Satan and they must burn.

4. They live on the other side of campus: If you want me to walk 15 minutes in the cold in the dead of winter across campus to talk to you about how your classes went, it better be true love or I am not leaving my bed.

5. They party too much: Club going up on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Most of your conversations are you yelling to each other in a dark basement and you are pretty sure you have gone on a total of maybe two sober dates.

6. They party too little: It is a Friday night and the vodka is calling, but they want to stay in and do a marathon of Tarantino movies. Again. You feel guilty going out without them, but you feel like you are missing out if you just stay in. It may be the alcoholic in me talking, but sometimes, the Jell-o shots are better than cuddling.

7. Bad hygiene: Maybe buying cologne and perfume for their birthday was not enough of a hint. It is time to get them to do the ALS soapy bucket of warm water challenge. You love them, but you have tried it all: from scattering deodorants over their room to dental floss in the math notebook.

8. They are taking Bio 204: The chances of them having time to go out on a date/anywhere besides the confines of the library are slim to none.

9. Bad physical chemistry: The date went great. The sex…not so much. If you are seriously invested in the relationship, it may be too late. But if things are still fresh, you still have time to book it. My advice? Be optimistic and follow the words of my piano teacher: Practice! Practice! Practice!

10. It is simply time: All good things must come to an end, especially if they were not so great at the start. And sometimes, there is no good reason, just that it is not working out. So follow Fall Out Boy and say thanks for the memories…even if they weren’t so great.]]></content:encoded>

“This chance is not just for me.”

That chance, for Adrian Coxson, is a shot at living out his dream.

Coxson, a wide receiver who played his final football season at Stony Brook in the fall, has been through it all since he committed to Penn State in April of 2009.

In a way, six years before the biggest day of his life on April 1, Coxson started a journey that no four-star high school football recruit wants to go on.

The Baltimore, Md. native took off his Nittany Lion cap and replaced it with a Florida Gator one before he ever got to college. He was headed to Gainesville, where current star NFL wide receivers Percy Harvin and Riley Cooper had recently graduated.

Florida was the place to be. They had Urban Meyer, notorious for getting the best out of his players, in a program that had just graduated arguably one of the best college football players in recent memory, Tim Tebow. For those who dream of playing professional football, Gainesville is like paradise.

But, everything changed before Coxson could get through the entirety of his first training camp at Florida.

Living nearly 1,000 miles away from his home in Maryland, the distance was just too far.

For the City College alumnus, everything is about family. So when his father got sick, the only son of the Coxson bunch put his priority first. He transferred to the University of Maryland, then under the leadership of Head Coach Ralph Friedgen, to be close to home.

Everything could have gone smoothly from there, but it did not. When Friedgen left, so did Coxson’s playing time. Under a new regime, he only totaled four catches for 90 yards and a touchdown as a redshirt freshman in the rare moments during which he escaped the sideline.

Again, his journey’s wheel spun around and around. This time, the pointer landed out on Long Island, under Head Coach Chuck Priore at Stony Brook. It was the fourth stop on Coxson’s college journey and would be his last. A top-20 receiver in the entire country at the time of his high school graduation, the 6-foot-1-inch playmaker ended up at the home of a running-oriented offense at the FCS level, the second tier of Division I Football.

There is no way of getting around it. Stony Brook is not Penn State, Florida, or Maryland. That is something that Coxson had thought about over the years.

“I’ve learned to live with now the whole process that I went through to get to where I’m at,” Coxson admitted. “I used to think about how, ‘I could have done this at Florida, I could have done this at Maryland.’”

But, the 22-year old has found a way to put things in perspective after three seasons at a program in transition to arguably the best conference in Division I-AA, the Colonial Athletic Association.

“I’m still getting the opportunity that I would,” Coxson said. “I’m still getting an opportunity to play in the NFL.”

That, at the end of the day, is a lofty goal for any kid growing up. It does not matter how many yards one gains in high school or how many touchdowns a player can grab−it means nothing if that same production does not continue into college and beyond, no matter the school.

In an offense at Stony Brook that is known for its ground-and-pound mentality, it is not easy to get touches at the wide receiver position. Since Coxson arrived on Long Island in 2012, the Seawolves have run the ball for at least 61 percent of the snaps in each season that has gone by.

Yet, Coxson showed at times that his big play ability was still there. His 43 catches for 664 yards this past season may not jump off paper, but what will were three of his six touchdowns. He took it 61 yards to the house to open the year against Bryant, 83 yards against William &amp; Mary and 79 yards at Albany.

No matter the level of competition those were against, there were 11 men on another team that could not tackle him. That is not something to sneeze at.

As the season ended and Coxson completed his studies, there were still months before April 1, his pro day, likely the last chance that Coxson will have to prove to NFL scouts and teams that he deserves a chance. There, he must show his physical ability in events such as the 40-yard dash, bench press and a variety of other drills.

That is where Super Bowl champion and 10-year NFL veteran Qadry Ismail came into the picture. Coxson had met Matt Zenitz, Maryland football beat writer for the Baltimore Sun Media Group in high school, who connected him and the former ESPN NFL analyst.

“He’s working out really well,” Ismail said. “[I’m] very impressed.”

For all intents and purposes, both the former pro and Stony Brook student-athlete have the same end-goal in mind: for Coxson to find a way into the NFL Draft.

“What I’ve seen is he is every bit of a very good, fluid moving, very fast young man with the size,” Ismail said, adding that the Seawolf has other naturally gifted qualities as well. “You mix that with the strong work ethic, then you wind up having a guy that could literally be very effective when it comes to helping himself move up the draft.”

Coxson has listened to every word that Ismail has said during their time on and off the field, just as he should, as he is getting to work with a man who caught 33 touchdowns in the NFL.

“I’m just learning all the technique that he knows,” the Seawolf said. “I’ve gotten faster over the past few weeks in working with him.”

That is something for a player who has already shown that he can burn his coverage deep. However, he has taken everything in the process one step at a time.

“My first goal was to work out, get ready for the all star game,” Coxson said about playing in the College Gridiron Showcase on Jan. 31., an exhibition that gives draft hopefuls a chance to show their talent in front of over 100 scouts. “I did that. “

“My next goal was to have a good week of practice at the all star game,” he said, but he did more than that, as some scouts even took to social media to mention that the FCS receiver caught their attention.  “I had a great week of practice.”

“I had to prove that I still was able to play with that level of competition that I once played with coming out of high school,” Coxson said. “I feel like I did that.”

Just like many kids growing up, he has dreamt of becoming one of the few that earns the right to play football on the biggest stage: the NFL.

Unlike those others, he has a different motive to do so.

“I think about my son going into every workout,” Coxson said. The talented route runner enjoyed the birth of his son after his junior season at Stony Brook. "This one shot that I get can make his life so much easier growing up.”

He is right, as even those who do not make the active roster of an NFL team, but manage to earn a spot on the practice squad, make a minimum of $6,300 per week.

“One, I love the game of football,” Coxson said about what accomplishing his goals would do for him. “Two, I have the chance to put my family in a better position financially, to help them, you know, ease their life a little bit.”

So, every hour-long drive to the facility just north of Baltimore where Coxson trains for an hour to an hour and a half at 5 a.m., to the pool workouts and flexibility work following it, the time in the hot tub, cardio and football drills that fill up his life, everything becomes worth it.

“If I do as well as I know I will,” Coxson said, looking ahead to his pro day. “I’ll put myself in a good position to get drafted.”

To get to that point, he wants NFL teams to know that he brings more than just route running and speed to the table.

“I’m a very physical player, a very hard worker and I love to block,” Coxson said. “I can turn a 5 yard play into an 80 yard touchdown.”

“I think you know one of the things that I’ve spoken with scouts before about is what do you do in big time moments and games?” Ismail said “What scouts will then say is, ‘Oh look, we want to take a chance on him because he’s showed up, because he’s been a tremendous blocker.”

Despite only recently starting their work together, Coxson has learned a lot from his mentor.

“It’s helped me tremendously, because he’s been through everything that I’ve been through as far as this NFL process,” he said. “He played on the big stage, so he knows what it takes to get to the level of play that I need to be at in order to perform at the pro day.”

It is that stage that Coxson wants to reach one day, for his love of a sport and, more importantly, the love of his family.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>How sex affects athletic performance is still unresolved</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_35261" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-35261" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SPORTS_SOC-WCUP_2_ZUM-600x377.jpg" alt="ZUMA PRESS / TNS" width="600" height="377" /> During the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, teams like Mexico did not allow their players to have any sex, while teams like Brazil said sex was allowed as long as it was not "acrobatic." <em>ZUMA PRESS / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE</em>[/caption]

The athlete’s process of reaching to physical and psychological shape in anticipation of the big game or event is meticulous. Every meal, every nap, every routine has to be in accordance with what will keep an athlete in peak readiness.

But what about sex? It may seem arbitrary, but there have been many myths regarding how sex affects athletic performance, both physically and mentally.

This major question was huge during the 2014 World Cup, where many teams had provisions against sex for their players. Russia, Chile, Bosnia, Herzegovina and Mexico did not allow their players to have any sex, according to<a href="http://qz.com/221777/world-cup-sex-rules/"> Quart</a>z.

Nigeria’s players could only have sex with their wives, Spain and Germany banned sex on the night before a match and Brazil allowed sex but only if it was not “acrobatic.”

This being a serious matter among some sports teams, what does the hard science say? Not a whole lot that is concrete, it turns out.

A<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/30/us-oly-sex-day-idUSBRE86T0TW20120730"> Reuters article</a> on the topic read, “so far, having sex has not been found to reduce physical strength, power or endurance.”

It went on to list multiple studies that saw no changes in a variety of physical tests without and with sex.

A study published in the<a href="http://journals.lww.com/cjsportsmed/Fulltext/2000/10000/Does_Sex_the_Night_Before_Competition_Decrease.1.aspx"> Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine</a> read, “the performance of some people will improve with sex the night before competition (i.e., responders) and the performance of others will be hindered (i.e., nonresponders).”

A common theme in all of these studies is that they are focused on physical effects, not the psychological.

"There was a point where I had to be like OK, this is way too distracting," Olympic snowboarder Jamie Anderson told<a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jamie-anderson-olympic-snowboarder-tinder-in-the-olympic-village-is-next-level-2014122"> Us Weekly</a> in regards to the dating application Tinder. "I deleted my account to focus on the Olympics."

The question of mental effects is likely why Nigeria had their players only have sex with their wives: to avoid relationships that may be considered a distraction.

In the life of an athlete, everything plays a factor in how they perform on the court, field, diamond, etc. Whether or not there is a real effect, their personal lives are now under the microscope as well.]]></content:encoded>

Why does it seem like first dates are limited to the same played out dinner and movie ordeals and are exclusively the product of meeting someone on Tinder these days?  As young, educated, vibrant college students, I can not help but feel like we have something more to offer in the realm of courtship. It is practical to assume that none of us want to look back on what are supposed to be the best times of our lives and recount the awful movies and bad-tasting Long Island restaurant meals we have eaten while forcing ourselves to feign interest in someone.

Sitting in a darkened theater, discouraged from making conversation may not be the best way to assess if someone’s character is of interest to you. There are ways around the obvious first date choice. Here are some date ideas that break the mold:

The Explorer Date: Suited for people with a sense of adventure. Geocaching is an app that takes any given location worldwide and gives you hints that lead you to particular points in your surrounding area.  At these points are hidden capsules. When you find the capsule, there is usually a tiny notepad left to write your name and the date you visited. It is also typical to leave a small item related to you in the capsule. If the relationship lasts, it may be a fun idea to go back to the first location you found together and see your names in the notepad. Sappy, I know. Also, this is an ideal date if you want to throw in a dinner. The two of you can stuff your face as per the traditional date and walk it off with some geocaching. You’re welcome.

The Musician Date: Now, some people may think the only concerts that are worthwhile are the ones held in pricey venues with well-known bands. For dates, the unheard of band in that small bar across the street might be the perfect scene. Since no one is fighting for a spot to see the band perform, you can enjoy the beauty of personal space as you share some notoriously delicious finger-food.  If the band you are seeing ever becomes popular enough, it will always be a cool story when years from now you can say you saw them when they played in a rundown bar near your alma mater.

The Outdoorsmen Date: For people who appreciate nature and the feel of the good old outdoors, Avalon Park and Preserve is a perfect place for a first date. Located in Stony Brook, the park offers scenery worth photographing and memorable locations at which to stare into one another’s eyes. While this may be a date you would want to save for sunny, spring weather, if you are willing to brave the cold for an hour or two, going to a coffee shop or teahouse after would be a nice way to warm up while holding conversation. Try to stay away from a Starbucks. Its aroma and atmosphere may be too reminiscent of the one on campus, and who knows what that could do to your seemingly special date.

The Gamer Date: If you know the person you are trying to impress is into the same types of video games you play, an interesting idea would be to invite them to play a game with you.  Friendly competition is always a fun means to get flirtatious banter going and can be an ongoing topic of conversation. Snacks like chips and soda are easy to get a hold of and are compatible with the type of date this is. Once together, the two of you can explore common interests and dislikes that will create further conversation.

The Chef Date: A cooking class could be an enjoyable way to try something new while learning new things about the person you are pursuing. While preparing a new dish, conversations can range from cooking experience and food preferences. From there, the possibilities are endless. When the class comes to an end, the date can continue into a home-cooked dinner for two. For a wallet-friendly option, Stony Brook students are offered free cooking lessons from Campus Dining. Cooking 101 is held three times a week and the menu is posted online so you can decide if you like the dish. In about an hour, you will have a culinary masterpiece. Voila!

Regardless of if you chose any of these options or not, remember that no one likes being bored. Also, if you do get the coveted second date, make sure to be just as fun and impressive or else things can go downhill really fast. Good luck out there Seawolves—the dating world is a tough place.

The definition of role-playing, courtesy of Urban Dictionary: A bedroom practice in which partners dress up and pretend to be someone else for sexual satisfaction.

Why do people role-play? Sometimes, sex itself is very intimidating if you are not 100 percent comfortable with your sexual partner—so wouldn’t adding costumes and characters into the mix just make it that much more “scary?”

Role-playing may be something private that sexual partners do in the bedroom together, but based on the various role-playing lists on Buzzfeed, like “25 sexy role play confessions that will either scare you…or give you some ideas,” it seems like it is something people are willing to talk about.

Some of the scenarios on the list include schoolgirl fantasies (how cliché), a coach/athlete role-play, physical examination role-play and a “Mad Men” role-play…just to name a few.

Cosmopolitan also published its own list online, titled “Role play ideas you’ve never tried before.” On this list, they talk about reading out loud a passage from a book where the characters engage in sex, such as any passage from “50 Shades of Grey,” and then replaying it in your own way.

Suggesting sexual role-play to your sexual partner does not mean that you are not happy with your current sex life, it just means spicing things up a bit.

“Couples role-play for a variety of reasons. On a basic level, role-playing allows couples to introduce a level of novelty into their sexual relationships,” Nicholas Eaton, Ph.D. and assistant professor at Stony Brook said. “If couples are sexually monogamous, they may find that role-playing allows them to experience some degree of sexual exploration—although they are with the same partner, the roles played may provide new experiences and identities,” he added.

Eaton also said that his lab recently completed data collection on sexual behaviors of about 1,000 people. The participants of this study answered the question on how sexually appealing they find role playing on a seven-point scale.

According to Eaton, the data showed that 78 percent of women and 81 percent of men rated sexual role-playing as “somewhat appealing.” 24 percent of women and 26 percent of men rated the sexual role-playing to be the highest level on the scale, which was “very appealing.”

“Many individuals in their lives will experiment with role-playing, and some will make it a regular part of their sexual lives. Our data suggest that this follows from a notably high level of attraction to role-playing in women and in men, with around one person in four reporting that role-playing is at the maximum level of sexual appeal,” Eaton said.

Sexual role-playing can also be useful to couples who are perhaps having difficulties sexually.

“There will be times where I will suggest sexual role-play as one of the things that they [patients] can do to jumpstart their sexual relationship,” Peter Kanaris, Ph.D. and sex therapist said.

However, Kanaris added that it is important not to just throw suggestions to couples, such as role-playing. You need to know the person and know what they will be comfortable with.

“There are some people that are very into role-playing sexually and it sort of is something that their sexuality is strongly connected to. And there are other people that are just a little more carefree and would like to experiment with something different,” he said.

Many people experiment with role-playing as a way to explore further intimacies, but he mentioned that there is that population of people whose sexual script is very narrowly based on a specific role-play.

“So in order to be sexual they will almost need it,” he said.

“There are some folks that are fairly inhibited that almost, like, need permission to do something different and to try something out,” he said when he talked about how sexual role-playing can free people like that up.

Role-playing can be a very “freeing” experience; it is sometimes healthy to indulge in your own fantasies.

“I think role-play is great. It gives an opportunity for people to experience fantasies that they otherwise could not,” Tristan Tyrell, a senior geology major and TNG treasurer, said.

So what is the best way to go about approaching role-playing?

“I honestly would ask my partner flat out. I'm not good with subtlety, and if my partner(s) find that weird, well they probably going to find a lot of things I like weird, so it for the better,” Tyrell said.

Richie Moylan, a first year graduate student studying social work, feels the same way.

“The most important thing is to be on the same page, especially in terms of expectations. Part of the reason role-playing can be such a healthy experience is that it fosters better communication between partners,” he said.

That is the best way for any couple to go about it. You cannot expect your partner to just know what you want. If you want to know if your partner is into role-playing—whether it be with cop/culprit, teacher/student or maybe even Spiderman/Mary Jane—the key to successful role-playing is to be upfront and honest. It could be a little awkward to get into it, but once you start, you may not want to stop.

Moylan also said that as long as both parties are comfortable, he does not think that there is a limit on “weirdness.” Everybody is into something.

For him, anything involving a teacher/student scenario is too weird for his liking.

“Absolute strangest I've heard of is father-daughter role-play,” he said.

Everybody has fantasies, even if they do not admit it. Indulging in your fantasies can be a healthy and quite normal thing. When a couple gets to the point in their relationship when they are comfortable enough to discuss sexual fantasies, then maybe that is when they are ready to put them into action. Of course, everyone is different.

Moylan also talked about how role-playing can enhance intimacy in dominant/submissive relationships.

“It allows partners to be more open about their desires, and express them in a safe, controlled environment,” he said.

So, if you are curious about role-playing, then why not give it a try? It does not mean that your current sex life is no good or that you are bored with your partner—it just gives you the opportunity to spice things up and have a little bit of fun. So go ahead, open that door to the kinky thoughts that you usually tuck away. Your partner may love it.]]></content:encoded>

The annual day of love is around the corner, which means that chocolates are flooding stores. But chocolate is not the only food associated with Valentine’s Day. For this special edition of College Gal Cooking, <i>The Statesman</i> looked into some of the foods that get people’s heart pumping and found mixed results when it came to the success of food aphrodisiacs. Some foods may not make your partner swoon and increase arousal, but here are some of the foods that have a sweet surprise.

1. Chocolate—Chocolates are everywhere on the days leading up to and on Valentine’s Day. According to the <a href="http://www.commerce.gov/blog/2014/02/14/census-bureau-releases-valentine%E2%80%99s-day-related-facts-and-statistics">Census Bureau</a>, 1,148 manufacturing facilities in America produced chocolate and cocoa products for Valentine’s Day in 2011. This savory sweet treat contains phenylethylamine, PEA, according to <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/inside-the-mind/emotions/chocolate-high1.htm">howstuffworks</a>. PEA is called the “love drug,” as it releases the same chemicals that humans release when they fall in love. <a href="http://www.swansonvitamins.com/swanson-premium-pea-phenylethylamine-500-mg-60-caps">Swanson Health Products</a> asserts that this compound helps release both dopamine and norepinephrine. Dopamine is a hormone that controls the brain’s reward system and pleasure centers. Norepinephrine, according to Swanson Health Products, supports the body’s response to stress. It increases heart rate, which increases blood flow to the body’s muscles among other things. But <a href="http://www.m.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/features/aphrodisiacs-fact-or-fiction?page=3">WebMD</a> is one of several sites stating that the human body does not absorb enough PEA from chocolate to have a strong effect.

2. Oysters—What is so seductive about slurping one or more of these shellfish down? Well, oysters are high in zinc, according to the <a href="http://www.coastseafoods.com/nutrition.html">Coast Seafoods Company</a>’s website. The site says that there is 76.7 mg of zinc in six medium sized oysters—the suggested daily amount for adults is 8 to 11 mg. According to <a href="http://www.healthline.com/health-slideshow/zinc-and-erectile-dysfunction#4">healthline.com</a>, zinc may assist those with erectile dysfunction. Livestrong.com also says that zinc helps males’ testes function—deficiencies in zinc may effect sperm production. The <a href="http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Zinc-HealthProfessional/">National Institute of Health </a>also states that zinc deficiency can lead to the delay in sexual maturity. But caution comes with eating these bi-valves. <a href="http://www.livestrong.com/article/435577-side-effects-of-eating-oysters/">Livestrong.com</a> states that the location and time of the year are key when harvesting oysters. Oysters can contain the vibro vulnificus bacterium, which can be harmful when consumed. Although the number of this bacteria increases during warmer weather, livestrong.com claims the bacteria can also infect oysters picked during the colder months.

3. Honey—This natural, sticky sweetener contains the mineral boron. The <a href="https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/minerals/boron.html">Organic Facts</a> website claims that deficiencies in this mineral may lead to sex hormone imbalance among other health issues. The site also reports that boron enhances testosterone levels. There are mixed findings whether honey does increase testosterone levels. However, the <a href="http://anabolicmen.com/testosterone-vitamins-and-minerals/">Anabolic Men</a> website says this mineral lowers the Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) count. SHBG binds into the “free testosterone molecules,” which simply put makes testosterone molecules unusable.

4. Avocado—Not only does this fruit’s name mean testicles, but avocados contain vitamin B6 and folic acid. <a href="http://www.evitamins.com/a/vitamins-increase-woman-s-sex-drive-67#.VL1Zw0fF-So">EVitamins</a> is one of several sites to report that vitamin B6 decreases the shift of hormones like estrogen and progesterone during menopause. According to the site, it is this shift that result in the loss of sex drive for older women. Additionally, the vitamin B complex—vitamin B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B12—help with blood flow throughout the body. <a href="http://www.care2.com/greenliving/boost-your-libido-with-vitamin-b.html/2">Care2</a>’s site stated that vitamin B6 in particular protects the heart from homocysteine—a chemical that allows cholesterol deposits. Maintaining a healthy heart decreases the risk of developing erectile dysfunction. Folic acid is a form of the B vitamin, which can prevent various birth defects. It is also one of the essential nutrients for women who want to get pregnant as it leads to healthy eggs as mentioned on the <a href="http://www.ovuline.com/guide/31/boost-your-fertility">Ovuline </a>website.

These are just some of the foods and the vitamins or chemicals found within them. Many of the foods above have a variety of other health benefits. Despite some of the sexual health benefits of these foods, what makes food aphrodisiacs fun is not necessarily eating it, but how it is eaten.

“Jupiter Ascending,” directed by Lana and Andy Wachowski, is a sci-fi action film that targets adults, adolescents and lovers of action movies.  It captivated movie goers with the actors’ performances, the visual effects and the intense action.

The movie tells the story about how the Earth and several other planets have been “seeded” by alien royalty so that they could be harvested in order to create “youth serum” and make their kind live forever.

However, Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis), an unsuspecting human caretaker for her family in Chicago, discovers that she is royalty and the new heir to Earth.  During a visit to the doctor, Jones is trapped by aliens who are disguised as doctors and they test her to see if she is the new heir.

Caine Wise, played by Channing Tatum, a genetically engineered warrior and ex-military hunter, saves Jupiter from the alien army that sought to kill her.

Balem Abrasax is played by “Theory of Everything" star Eddie Redmayne. Abrasax is the antagonist of the film. He wants Jupiter, the new heir to Earth, dead in order to claim the planet for himself.  With the aliens targeting Jupiter, Wise has a duty to protect her and ensure the Earth’s survival.

Kunis’ performance in the film was full of passion when she played Jupiter Jones.  During the climactic scene, her character confronts Balem about saving her family. Fighting him showed that Kunis was dedicated and would not give up, which made her performance more convincing.

Tatum’s performance demonstrated his commitment to his character as well. The “22 Jump Street” star made his character, Caine, look fierce and realistic.  He wore a mouthpiece while wearing his costume in order to make his jaw appear smaller. This also makes it difficult for a person to speak.

The story about an heir to planet Earth and a person discovering who she really is was interesting, but also average.

Although their characters were in love with each other, Kunis and Tatum showed a lack of chemistry in their performances.  During the final battle scene where Jupiter was trying to save her family, Tatum and Kunis kiss. There was little emotion between the two during this scene.

The visual effects of the movie, however, had the audience glued to their seats.  The spaceships traveling from one planet to another and the explosions on the planet Jupiter during the climactic scene of the movie made the film intriguing. The battle in Chicago and the intergalactic battle scenes in the movie demonstrated intense sci-fi action.

Aside from the one red flag about the lack of chemistry between the actors, “Jupiter Ascending” is a must see movie for those who are interested in Kunis, Tatum and intense sci-fi action.]]></content:encoded>

MANJU SCHIVACHARAN / THE STATESMAN " width="600" height="400" /> Winter Storm Juno dropped more than 20 inches of snow on Long Island from Jan. 25 to Jan. 26. The snowfall this winter has already resulted in missed Monday classes being rescheduled for Friday, March 6 and Friday, March 27.<br /><em>MANJU SCHIVACHARAN / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

When I was a young lad around the age of ten with an innocent and malleable mind, I had an incredibly skewed perception of the world and the people around me. I am sure you can relate.

Every occurrence and every person I met in life was filled with wonder, joy, mystery and excitement. Everything that happens, happens for the first time. Everyone you meet is a new friend. Basically, life is new, easy and simple.

Despite the fact that most of us, by this point in our lives, have grown out of our once immensely powerful imaginations, there is one thing that keeps us young—it is white, sometimes fluffy and falls from the heavens.

You guessed it: snow.

When it falls, it comes with a few good things. Among them are days off from school and work, snowball fights, igloos, snowmen, snow angels and sledding.

We embrace this frozen precipitation every time it arrives. But when is it too much? When is cancelling class over and over again too much? When do boring nights sipping hot cocoa by the fireplace become too much?

When do we get tired of no work and only play? And when does it start to take away from our experience as students?

Well, the reality of the matter is that that time has come. Snow, please stop screwing us over.

Winter Storm Juno dumped almost 20 inches of snow onto much of Long Island, and with another storm on its way before Juno’s mess can melt away, we have to stop and think, practically, just how much snow sets us back as students.

Let’s start with the disgruntling fact that because we have not yet had class on a Monday (which is awesome, do not get me wrong), we are going to be forced to make up for that lost time on Fridays (March 6 and 27). I normally do not have class on Fridays, and I am sure a lot of you reading this do not either. Just the thought of going to class on my special days off makes me wonder about how much material in any class can be thrown out.

Maybe professors can find a way to condense lessons and finish them faster.

I mean think about it: in every class that you take in college, I would say there are at least two days of class that go right down the drain.
It just worries me that so many people will have to restructure their schedules, take off work or research, and to a certain extent change their study plans in order to attend an additional class. We will see how that works.

The second thing about the snow is that it makes getting around campus, whether it be on foot or by car, all the more difficult. Obviously, walking on snow and ice presents students with great danger.

Slips, falls and injuries are essentially inevitable. Even though the walkways on campus are usually adequately salted, poor walking conditions just make it less appealing and usually exciting (implying that it is fun) to walk to class on an already blistering cold night.
The only problem with the way in which Stony Brook cleaned up the accumulation, is that the parking lots remain largely untouched.
Hundreds of cars were stuck in their respective lots this past weekend and it was up to each and every individual driver to somehow obtain a shovel and dig his or her own vehicle out of the frozen tundra.

Despite the fact that drivers, for the most part, cleaned their spots, most spaces are still covered with thick layers of what seems like unbreakable ice. This makes getting in and out of spots an adventure. One that can lead to damaging your car. That is definitely not something anyone wants.

The sad reality of adulthood is that snow, despite its beauty and fluffiness, has become an inconvenience for students and faculty alike.

We are at the mercy of Mother Nature. What else can we do but pray the storm this coming weekend saves us from even more Friday classes?

To be honest, we just have to toughen up and deal with it.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Fall down and spring awake</title>

There is nothing more enjoyable than the back-to-school feeling in late August.
It is the smell of new books in the old summer air, the excited new faces swapping camp war stories, and all the other minutia that goes into a fresh year that makes me eager to get back to SBU.
This excitement, though, fades rapidly as I think about what is really set out in front of me: fall semester.
The structure of fall semester begets an environment of exponentially increasing stress for every student, especially freshmen. We have little to no downtime, which leads to an unhealthy learning environment. The university is generous enough to give us one day off right at the beginning of the semester (although no one really wants or needs it), but then we are cut off from any semblance of rest until Thanksgiving, which is too little, too late.
Part of the collegiate lifestyle is getting the chance to develop oneself civilly as well as academically. The lack of any rest or relaxation does not permit that, thus is the reason why so many students have such difficulty in the fall. For many students, the trend in the fall is predictable: work piles up, stress ensues, sleepless nights trying to figure it out, lack of concentration in class, repeat ad nauseam. This often leads to a severe drop in grades and quickly worsens mental states. As we have all seen, this can have disastrous effects around fall finals time, especially on this campus.
Being a freshman or a new transfer dealing with all of this can have detrimental and sometimes unforeseen effects. I spoke to Yvette Karvay, a freshman psychology major, about her experiences during her first semester. When asked about how the fall semester took its toll she explained, “the reason the semester is so awful is because it begins with beautiful weather and ends with piles of un-doable work and the blistery cold of an approaching depressing winter.” She said that procrastination was something that she could get away with during high school.
At Stony Brook, though, “tomorrow and next week never really come [for studying]. Work really piles up and courses hit their peak of difficulty. The days dwindle and become sad and cold causing all motivation to disappear.”
Having this as your first exposure to college serves to breed a mindset of struggle and often, as she said, depression.
On the other end of the spectrum, we have the refreshing spring semester. Broken up into seven weeks on each side of spring break, the spring semester seems to be a walk in the park, sometimes filled with stopping to smell the springtime roses. A more spaced-out schedule means more time to relax, reflect and compose oneself. Many professors give their midterms the week before break, which allows students to decompress and often cut loose during the week off.
Instead of bombarding students with an insurmountable workload, this split breaks the semester down into two halves that almost feel like two mini-semesters in one. I know I always come back from the break feeling refreshed and rejuvenated, keen to finish out the little bit of the year I have left.
Although fall has Homecoming to get excited about, spring semester has the added flare of a plethora of Stony Brook traditions that students look forward to all year long. The university hosts Recyclemania and Earthstock in the spring, as well as Diversity Day during Strawberry Fest. 
A few big staples in Stony Brook life happen in the spring too like Brookfest and Roth Regatta. Students come out in droves for the music, the boat race and to celebrate the end of the year with their fellow Seawolves. 
All of these occasions allow students to socialize and breathe a little easier while maintaining their academic success. It is clear for everyone to see that these events make for an awesome campus environment.
It is apparent that this social spring environment leads to good civics. Anybody would agree that it is nicer to live in a welcoming environment where people are good to each other and are decent and dignified as opposed to an environment of hostility and antagonism. Good civics will lead to a better learning and an overall healthier, happier and more successful campus environment. After such a lovely semester sprinkled with fun, excitement and tradition, I know we are all ready to take our place in the sun.]]></content:encoded>

Sex, drugs and alcohol. This magical trifecta is usually used to describe college life, often negatively and by people who may not have any idea what they are talking about.

But, at the most technical level, they are not wrong.

Sex, drugs and alcohol are a very real part of college life, but just how big of a part these things play is up to you. And seeing how drugs are illegal and most of us can not drink until our last couple of semesters, sex is all that is left. And that too is a choice, up to you and you alone.

But, other factors will come into play; peer pressure and the worry that “everyone is doing it [literally] and you are not.” Regardless, the decision is still yours.

One the many jobs of a Resident Assistant is to help you make that decision safely. Which basically translates to “We have a bunch of condoms and stuff, if you need them, ask. No judgment, I promise.”

Every college office in every residence hall has some sort of receptacle that is filled to the brim with what can be collectively referred to as HIV Prevention Materials.

 It is the RA’s duty to hand these materials out and make them available for any and all students to use.
Amazingly, I have only seen people come in to the office specifically to get something out of there only two or three times throughout a whole semester and I am not sure why. It could be that most people buy their own condoms. Maybe people feel awkward coming into the office for condoms.

To that, I say that sex is a natural thing and no one should be ashamed about it. Safe sex is important and the materials are there for anyone who needs them. That is why we have so many. Like seriously, a lot. Let me try to paint a picture for you.

RAs get their first huge bag full of condoms during their summer training. This will usually last you the whole semester, if not longer. In that bag are dental dams, lube and female condoms as well as Ultra-Lubricated, Ultra-thin and Ultra-Sensitive Lifestyles condoms. It is literally a bag of everything you need and a lot of things you did not know existed.

Why every type of Lifestyles is prefixed with the word Ultra is a mystery (Maybe it is an Ultra-Mystery). In addition to their starter bags, RAs can request additional condoms to be given out at programs they put on. We usually get a bunch of the little BYOC (bring your own condom) packets that each have safe sex-ed information and a few condoms. Personally, I have about 200 to 300 condoms leftover from my programs. They are just sitting there.

RAs are given these materials so we can make them available to the residents, but let’s be honest; most of the time, the materials are used for messing around: for condom balloons and such. Let me give you a breakdown of what exactly goes into these “condom bowls” and what they actually end up getting used for.
First up are condoms. Now, typically condoms just get stretched over people’s arms or blown into balloons (sometimes with faces drawn on), but you can also actually flick an unopened condom like you would a playing card. They get some pretty good distance too. Next up are dental dams. These are stretched over your mouth to make funny faces.

Finger cots are only used for showing to people who have never heard of or seen them (imagine individual condoms for each of your fingers).

Same thing with female condoms. Whether or not this indicates a lack of proper sexual education in schools is an entirely different, and important, discussion. The only thing that does not get used for jokes is the rare packet of lube you might find in one of those bowls. 

And, on the even rarer occasion that you find a condom in the bowl that is not a Lifestyle (I will not even mention the possibility of finding a Trojan for fear of jinxing it for the whole campus), people will not throw those around. They will usually fight over them.

So what am I getting at here? Well, I know that the RAs, myself included, are here to help you guys. We have the materials here to make sure that you guys have safe sex instead of unprotected, unsafe sex, and we have a lot of them. Do not be ashamed if you come to us looking for all of the aforementioned products because there purpose is to be used by students just like you.]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Wolfie, Stony Brook’s beloved mascot, celebrated his 20th birthday during halftime of the men’s basketball game on Saturday, Feb. 7 by treating everyone in attendance to a variety of desserts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Wolfie, surrounded by Stony Brook cheerleaders, trotted around the court in his golden birthday crown and red cape while the marching band played “Happy Birthday.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The lobby was packed with fans who were eager for cupcakes and pudding before the marching band finished playing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As for his birthday wishes, Andrea Lebedinski, coordinator for Annual Giving and Branding of the Athletics Department and administrator of Wolfie, said Wolfie wants the men’s basketball team to reach The NCAA Tournament. Lebedinski added that Wolfie also wanted success for all sports teams.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Wolfie would also like to be a part of Capital One’s Mascot challenge, the March Madness for mascots, Lebedinski said in an email.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Wolfie took over as Stony Brook’s official mascot in the summer of 1995. Before that, Stony Brook was known as the Patriots.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although Wolfie cannot buy a drink yet, he has had quite a workload. According to Lebedinski, Wolfie averages nearly 500 events a year—sometimes five in one day.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To keep up with the public’s demand for Wolfie appearances, Lebedinski leads a 14-student “Wolfie Mascot Team.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This group is charged with booking and scheduling appearances for Wolfie.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The result is a “brand” that made Wolfie a local favorite and a growing national figure.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lebedinski emphasized the importance of the Wolfie brand to the school and the community.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Locally, Wolfie was named Three Village Sportsman of the Year and a finalist for Long Island Press’ Best Mascot contest from 2011 to 2013.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nationally, Wolfie made four consecutive appearances in New York City’s Columbus Day Parade and has accompanied Stony Brook sports teams to various states across America. He was also featured in ESPN’s College Game Day commercial back in 2011.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Now, Wolfie is ready to take over the social media scene. SBU’s mascot has flocks of followers on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Seawolves can watch Wolfie break out some dance moves to “Smooth Criminal,” or watch him demonstrate the Stony Brook Spirit on his YouTube page.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">There are seven students who play Wolfie. According to Lebedinski, these students do not only have the opportunity of playing the beloved mascot, but having the position also looks great on a resume and is a great conversation starter.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">But, the job also comes with great responsibilities once an applicant completes the tryout process. The student must abide by the “Mascot 10 Commandments,” a list of do’s and don’ts as Wolfie.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">The first rule for being Wolfie: absolutely no speaking. The individual who played Wolfie during the men’s basketball was not able to comment on this story.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">As for Wolfie’s 21st birthday next year, Lebedinski said there are some big plans in mind. Currently, Lebedinski cannot disclose what is in the works for Wolfie’s next birthday celebration.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

It ended very Taylor Swift-esque, with 'screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain,' except it was driving to Chili’s in the rain, not kissing." <em>CONTRA COSTA TIMES / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE</em>[/caption]

Chianti is red,
Vaginas are pink,
Valentine’s Day sucks,
And I need a drink.

On Saturday, couples around the country came together for a very special day and shared an overpriced meal from a prix fixe menu with dim lighting at a restaurant that reeked of desperation and everyone’s expensive “special night” cologne. They will have had someone take a picture of them kissing in their fancy outfits and sent it to all their single friends even though they already uploaded it to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, YikYak, MySpace and The Chicago Tribune. They held hands regardless of how uncomfortable it was and at the end of their night, they laid down happily in each other’s arms until someone farted or started snoring.
But these are not the only interesting characters that come out only on Valentine’s Day. Most people have that one friend (usually single) who complains about how Valentine’s Day is a stupid corporate scheme to make money off of people’s desperation to feel loved and say that they will not celebrate the holiday on principle because it goes against their feminist values. Most people also have that other friend (also single) who laments about how Valentine’s Day reminds them of how alone they are in the world while listening to Celine Dion and blowing their nose with one hand while they eat Nutella from the jar with the other, spoon optional.
I personally hate every single one of those people.They are missing the entire point of Valentine’s Day. Forget the fact that no one loves you and screw your overpriced fancy dinner at 9:15 because you did not make a reservation soon enough. 
Pay attention instead to all the sales on jewelry, chocolate and red lacy lingerie! Any self-loathing I experience about the fact that I will be spending Valentine’s Day with my parents will be outshined by the diamond necklace I bought myself. 
And whenever my relationship-clad friends feel compelled to tell me of their fondue-filled, dark-chocolate covered, rose-scented perfect date, I remind myself that I bought myself a beautiful diamond necklace for the person that I love most in the world. All they got was a bouquet of roses from Trader Joe’s. And I did not feel obligated to shave my legs.
Valentine’s Day is not just for people in a relationship, and being in a relationship does not make a good Valentine’s Day. The worst Valentine’s Day I have ever had was while I was in a relationship. It ended very Taylor Swift-esque, with “screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain,” except it was driving to Chili’s in the rain, not kissing.
The best Valentine’s Day I have ever had the pleasure to experience did not have the candlelit dinner and declarations of love spelled out in blood from the wounds of the thorns on long-stemmed roses. It involved watching Daniel Tosh’s stand up comedy in sweatpants and eating burritos from Old Kelly Dining, which everyone knows were the superior burritos. So if you are alone this snowy Saturday, put down the jar of Nutella and and let go of your anti-commercialism rant and just remember, all it takes to make a special day is not a special person, just some really good Mexican food.]]></content:encoded>

He is now the 835th." <em>ZUMA PRESS / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE</em>[/caption]

In recent news, anchor Brian Williams of the NBC Nightly News has been accused of fabricating the stories he has reported on and, in the case of other stories, just completely flat out lying about them. This includes the story that he was in a helicopter that was brought down by an RPG.

Besides the fact that his cowardice as a human being and a reporter is completely evident, due to the fact that he had to lie about a story in order to obtain a reputation within the field of journalism, people are now wondering if he will ever be able to report on the news again.

Though the answer is no, the reasons why he cannot do it are multi-faceted.

First and foremost, a journalist’s only source of validity is their credibility and reputation; if a journalist’s words or thoughts cannot be trusted without having to doubt the fact that what they are saying is completely true, then they cannot work within the field.

On top of this, the media will, in a twisted sense of irony, not let up on the fact that Williams lied about what he did.

Being that Williams was one of the most well-known faces in the world of journalism, people and reporters alike held Williams to a higher standard of reporting because they trusted him.

According to an article by Business Insider, Williams was, at one point, the 23rd most trusted man in America

He is now the 835th.

Now, I understand that many people are angry and upset at Williams because they trusted him, but I am more taken aback that he was a liar and, more importantly, a coward.

In my eyes, if he had to completely fabricate the fact that he was on a chopper that went down in order to make his story seem more “daring” and “heroic,” he should be viewed as being in the same standing as a receptacle of human waste.

By lying to the public about this story, he made himself look like some type of war hero who went through a horrible ordeal, and that takes away from the actual heroes that sacrificed their lives in the war.

So what other stories did this craven “reporter” lie about?

If Williams is to be trusted, then apparently he was not only shot out of the sky by an RPG, but he also flew into Iraq with the fabled Seal Team Six three days after the war in Iraq broke out and watched the Berlin Wall fall in person.

Now, if Williams was as good at lying as he was at was being a piece of trash, then he would have looked into the fact that journalists are not embedded into any units that undertake covert operations, nor was he actually in Iraq three days after the war broke out.

On top of this, Tom Brokaw was the only American reporter who was doing a live report of the Berlin Wall falling, with Williams coming on scene 12 hours after it fell.

However, the way he spins his stories made it seem like he was on the scene watching the wall come down, when in reality, he was not.

Williams had some sort of natural knack when it came to reporting the news; people trusted and believed him because they believed what he said was true. That, however, is not true anymore: he clearly cannot tell the difference between fact and fiction, even within the realms of his own life. His days of being a trusted news reporter are long gone, and unfortunately, his actions will not only lead to questions about his own credibility, but also that of every other person in the world of journalism.]]></content:encoded>

PHOTO CREDIT: BRIAN COLLE" width="600" height="458" /> The Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera (foreground) and vertically pointing radar (dish in background) will help researchers at SBU gather better data on snowstorms for better forecast models. <em>PHOTO CREDIT: BRIAN COLLE</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera, or MASC, a new addition to the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences, will help Stony Brook University researchers gather better data on snowstorms and create more accurate numerical models for forecasts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As part of the National Science Foundation project titled “Collaborative Research: Observations and modeling of mesoscale precipitation banding in cool-season winter storms,” the MASC was installed on top of Endeavor Hall in the south campus and serves to capture photos of snowflakes during snowstorms.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The research project is a collaborative effort between Stony Brook University and North Carolina State University aimed to reduce the amount of uncertainties of weather forecast by analyzing data collected during snowstorms, Sandra Yuter, professor of marine, earth, and atmospheric sciences at North Carolina State University and collaborator of the project, said in an email.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Brian Colle, professor of atmospheric science at the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences, leads the Stony Brook team and is in charge of numerical modeling and data collecting.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before the MASC, data collecting was done by “brute force” and often happened at the dead of night, Colle said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We were using a cold shed outside and a stereo-microscope,” he said. “We did this for several years with myself and students where we would go out in the middle of the storm and collect snowflakes on glass plate and study the flakes under the microscope.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Now they can collect and study snowflake data in the warmth and comfort of their homes and offices.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to Colle, the installation of the MASC not only reduced the amount of manual labor associated with data collection, but also sped up the collecting process.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“It was very manually extensive, and as a result we can only take an observation every 15 to 30 minutes,” he said. “But now this instrument is recording every time a snowflake triggers the sensors.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The MASC, developed by professor Tim Garrett of the University of Utah, roughly resembles an unfolded folding fan with three 5-megapixel cameras and three flashlights mounted on top, all pointing at a decagon shaped ring at one end of the device.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When a snowflake passes through a 1-by-1 inch area within the ring. The MASC captures close-up photos of it from three angles in real time, while measuring its descending speed. According to the MASC website, the camera can capture snowflakes ranging in size from 100 micrometers to three centimeters.</span></p>
<p class="p1">The photos are automatically composited and uploaded to a website that updates every 10 seconds and is accessible to the public.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The photographs offer two areas of focus for Colle and his colleagues: the habit type, or formation of snowflakes, and the amount of water captured by a snowflake as it descends through the clouds.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Understanding of cloud formations, or the lack there of, is a major contributing factor of inaccurate snow forecast.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">“To get the forecasts right, we have to understand the processes inside the clouds better,” Colle said.</span></p>
<p class="p1">According to Colle, snowflakes with more water attached to them form a denser and firmer snow that has a lower accumulation than snowflakes with less water, which form a fluffier and softer snow.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A recent example would be Winter Storm Juno. Weather forecasts predicted that the storm would bring 18–24 inches of snow accumulation with temperature near the freezing point in the Stony Brook area.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Colle and his team expected the MASC to capture photos of lighter, fluffier snow. Instead, the snowflakes captured more water, resulting in a denser snow that only accumulated to about 16 inches.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A Microwave Rain Radar, MRR, is used in unison with the MASC to collect the vertical profile of cloud structures about Stony Brook during snowstorms.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sara Ganetis, a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in marine and atmospheric sciences and research assistant on the project, compares the recorded data from both the MASC and MRR with previous weather models to evaluate patterns and inaccuracies.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We run our own weather model in a research setting to recreate storms,” she said. “So we need actual observations to compare to what we are creating to see if it’s actually usable to study small scale processes and the detail of the actual storms.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">The project will last for three years with plenty of work to be done and snowstorms to be had, but Colle describes himself as “one of the few people that looks forward to going to work during a snowstorm.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

PHOTO CREDIT : STONYBROOK.EDU[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Science and the humanities were brought together on Friday night in a lecture titled, “The Evolution of Human Languages,” given by Mark Pagel. In commemoration of Darwin Day, the guest speaker emphasized the importance of the natural selection theory in the field of linguistics in the Earth and Space Sciences lecture hall.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pagel is a fellow of the Royal Society, professor of evolutionary biology at Reading University in the United Kingdom, and author of “Wired for Culture: The Natural History of Human Cooperation.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“All animals communicate, even most plants communicate, but humans are the only species with languages,” Pagel said, further elaborating that by language, he means the use of coherent sentences. “Your pet dog can tell you it’s angry, it can even tell you how angry it is, but it cannot tell you its life story.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">His research has shown that there are over 7,000 different languages, but half of the world’s population uses the top ten to communicate. He also stated that about 30–50 languages go extinct every year and hypothesized that English will come out as the unifying language as it becomes more widespread.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Pagel recalled one of his experiences in Tanzania. He tried to speak to a man in broken Swahili, to which the man stopped him and responded that his English was better than the professor’s Swahili. This set the lecture’s theme that the languages of the world are becoming increasingly homogeneous and the use of technological connection across the globe, including social media, is speeding up this process.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He mentioned a story reported by The Guardian in which authorities attempt to disrupt this flow of languages when Quebec language police, an actual unit within the Quebec government, tried to ban the word “pasta” on a menu, claiming that the menu had too many Italian words.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Natural selection is constantly acting on words to choose the ones that work easiest because “the brain wants something that’s short and easy to pronounce,” Pagel said. “The words that we use most often are the ones that retain their ancestry over very long periods of time.”</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He demonstrated that the equivalent of the word “two” was strikingly similar throughout various languages, but the word for “bird” showed little to no resemblance, claiming this is so because the number is used more commonly throughout daily speech in all languages.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The lecture takes some important topics and brings people from many communities together and evolution is a major organizing force of humanity,” Jeffrey Levinton, a Stony Brook professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolution, stated. “There is an authenticity that this fellow is one of the world’s leading experts in language and the structure of language. You don’t get this on television.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Along with some of the university’s professors, the audience consisted of students and local residents, some of whom shared similar enthusiasm in the event. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">“I’m more interested in physics and astronomy so for me this was a quick study in a branch of science that I don’t typically get exposed to and it was great,” Elliot Serebrenik, who works as an engineer, reputed.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

Marissa Peterson advocated for a personalized solution based on each club's situation. SAHER JAFRI / THE STATESMAN" width="600" height="399" /> College of Arts and Sciences Sen. Marissa Peterson, above, advocated for a personalized solution based on each club's situation. <em>SAHER JAFRI / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Appropriations Act was the star of the show for the Feb. 12 USG senate meeting, passing by a vote of 18-1-0, but not before some misunderstandings and reconsideration.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Up for a vote was approximately $42,000 in unused club funds to be transferred to the USG grant appropriation. Nine clubs, due to anything from technical misunderstandings to internal disorganization, were found in violation of a section of USG’s financial bylaws that states, “A club/organization shall solely host at least one event per semester that is funded, in whole or in part, by the Student Activity Fee.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">USG Treasurer Kathryn Michaud stressed that e-board members from every club were required to attend a leadership conference and take a quiz regarding this section of the bylaws.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“If these clubs can’t use the budget, I think [the funds] should be allocated to other clubs,” Michaud said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Notable clubs and organizations that sent representatives to plead their cases included the Asian American Journal, Black Womyn’s Association and SB Ringers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The lengthy debate that ensued was boiled down to one main question—whether to hold all organizations to the same standard or not.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The fact is you broke the bylaws and you have to face the consequences, but there are ways to bounce back,” College of Arts and Sciences Sen. Chris Williams said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">With a bang on the table, Executive Vice President James Alrassi joked, “Hard-hitting, Senator Williams!”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, College of Arts and Sciences Sen. Marissa Peterson wished to see each organization in its own light and handle it on a case-by-case basis. Peterson was especially concerned with the situation of the Black Womyn’s Association, which had misunderstandings with USG over the activation of their secretary’s Campusvine account. This account is needed by e-board members to deal with budgetary concerns.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Their problem was very technical, and I feel the other clubs didn’t really know what they were doing as much,” Peterson said. “This club seems to just have purely technical reasons behind their vouchers.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After the debate, the act was put to a vote, and by a vote of 11-7-1, the Appropriations Act failed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Surprised, Michaud reminded the senators that the clubs and organizations could not use the funds anyway, regardless of the vote, because they violated the financial bylaws. The act was simply proposing to allocate the funds to the USG grant appropriation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Just as a point of clarification,” Michaud began, “…that was the whole point of this act.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After a groan of misunderstanding went over the room, the motion to reconsider passed, and the final motion to pass the act went through.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One notable topic of discussion was the budgets of groups who had no representatives at the meeting to vouch for their case.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Black Womyn’s Play Writer’s Guild (budget: $3,259.60), the National Association of Black Accountants (budget: $2,160) and the Young Americans for Freedom (budget: $3,771.75) were all on the agenda, but had no one present at the meeting to represent them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Other items on the agenda were the new Special Services Council budgets for Taiko Tides, a Japanese drumming group, and SBU TNG (The Next Generation), a group that teaches about the fetish community. The USG Senate avoided any debate in these areas and quickly passed both.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Every other week, graduate student Ricardo Raudales will take a look at Stony Brook science and research-related news.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">From smartphones to electric vehicles, lithium-based batteries seem to make the digital world go round. Yet despite their ubiquity, the basic concept behind lithium-based batteries has remained largely unchanged for over a decade and so far, improvements in performance have been relatively modest.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That may soon change thanks to new efforts by scientists at Stony Brook and Brookhaven National Laboratory to map the electronic pathways inside a new kind of multi-metallic battery. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a study published last month in Science, professor Esther Takeuchi and her colleagues tackled the question of how a highly conductive silver matrix could lead to better designs for lithium-based batteries. Takeuchi is a Stony Brook professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering and is chief scientist at Brookhaven Lab’s Basic Energy Sciences Directorate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Silver vanadium diphosphate is a new material we started investigating just a few years ago,” Takeuchi said. “Our goal was to develop a battery that would have a longer life than current batteries used to power implantable cardiac defibrillators.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We found that this material forms silver metal as the battery is first used,” Takeuchi said. “The silver metal initially exists as nanoparticles and then forms a conductive network within the electrode, which makes the battery work better.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To study this silver conductive network in action, Takeuchi and her colleagues developed an in situ way of analyzing batteries by measuring x-ray diffraction patterns. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The most common way to investigate a battery is to test it and then cut it open,” Takeuchi said. “However, the in situ method we developed was a significant change. We were able to use x-rays from the synchrotron (NSLS I) at Brookhaven, which are powerful enough to penetrate the steel casing of the battery. This allowed us to investigate the reactions taking place inside the battery without having to cut it open.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"This new method is significant in that it provides new types of information as the battery is not disturbed,” Takeuchi said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Using this technique, the researchers discovered that initial use of the battery changes the nature of the silver conductive network, such that slower formation leads to a more uniform conductive network.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Based on our findings, it appears we can overcome a life-limiting mechanism present in the batteries used today,” Takeuchi said. “The new system could, in turn, provide longer life.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Yet batteries are not the only material that can be studied with the new in situ technique. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">“We envision the method could be used more generally to study reactions that take place inside vessels,” Takeuchi said. “For example, it could be useful for catalysis, synthesis and the study of other chemical reactions.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The implications of a breakthrough battery design are undoubtedly huge, with many predicting that it could revolutionize the renewable energy sector as well as many consumer electronics. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While we await the battery revolution (or, at least, a smartphone that actually holds a charge for a day), Takeuchi had a few words of advice for budding Stony Brook scientists and engineers: “Science and engineering are becoming very exciting, especially with the new methods for investigation that are being developed. Stick with it, be curious, work hard and good things can happen.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

[caption id="attachment_35444" align="alignleft" width="600"]<a href="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MBB_Hanaa.Tameez_1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-35444" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MBB_Hanaa.Tameez_1-600x400.jpg" alt="After Stony brook's loss to Vermont, the Seawolves fought back to retain the ferocious play style.

After losing two consecutive games to conference foes New Hampshire and Vermont, the Stony Brook men’s basketball team looked to its stars to lead the team out of the recent skid and revitalize spirits as the season approaches the America East tournament. Jameel Warney and Carson Puriefoy did not disappoint.

The two juniors combined to shoot 77 percent from the field and score 43 combined points as the Seawolves toppled the UMBC Retrievers, 73-61, in convincing fashion Wednesday night in Baltimore, Md. Puriefoy’s 26 points led all scorers in the game, marking the fourth time this season he has scored at least 25.

Puriefoy was attacking the basket all night long, scoring a season-high eight two-point field goals. His persistence driving the lane earned him eight free-throw attempts as well. The seven conversions from the charity stripe brought Puriefoy’s free throw total this season to 99, which is the top mark in the conference.

Warney was a solid presence for Stony Brook on the low block all game long. The reigning Conference Player of the Year buried his first eight shots while playing solid defense. Warney totaled 17 points and eight rebounds in the game.

UMBC’s center Cody Joyce scored a game-high 24 points for the Retrievers, but Warney made him work for them. Joyce attempted 20 shots and only made seven, which was less than ideal efficiency for an upset-hungry UMBC squad.

The Retrievers kept the game competitive for much of the evening, taking a 35-31 lead early in the second-half. From there, Stony Brook went on a 17-7 run, sensitizing UMBC to its own inferiority in the match-up. Stony Brook’s second-half surge was highlighted by a fast-break dunk by Warney with 18:37 remaining, which regained the lead for the team in red and white.

Freshman Tyrell Sturdivant had a three-point play minutes later that deflated the Retriever Activities Center crowd of whatever life it still had. Junior Rayshaun McGrew was a force on the glass, leading the Seawolves with 12 boards.

As a team, Stony Brook out-rebounded UMBC 41-20 in the game.

On Valentine’s Day, love was in the air for the Seawolves, as they cruised to an 80-52 victory over the Maine Black Bears. Leading the way was redshirt freshman Roland Nyama who had a career-high 24 points, including six made three-pointers to lead the Seawolves in the onslaught.

“I’m just trying to have fun on the court and do what I love,” Nyama said after his performance.

The breakout game comes a bit unexpectedly, as Nyama had just seven points combined in his last three contests prior to the outburst. In fact, in the last calendar month, Nyama made all of his seven three-point shots. He would make six alone against Maine.

It was seemingly just another day at the office for Warney, who had his 17th double-double of the season, the most in the country, racking up 13 points and 11 rebounds.

Though the Black Bears did a solid job of containing him in the first half to just three points and one made field goal, the big man could not be held down for long, breaking out in the second half as the Seawolves pulled away.

The trend of dominating on the glass would be felt by the entirety of the Seawolves roster. It was not only Nyama who had a career afternoon, but McGrew as well. His 15 rebounds, seven of which came on the offensive glass, were a career-high.

He too would finish with a double-double, adding 10 points of his own. It nearly goes without saying that Head Coach Steve Pikiell was pleased with his team’s efforts.

“I particularly liked how we shared the game…A good win with contributions from a number of players.” he said.

Coming into the contest, the Seawolves knew they would have a massive advantage on the glass, but they would go on to lambast the undersized Black Bears, 52-28, on the boards.

Stony Brook would grab an astounding 20 offensive rebounds, which was nearly as many defensive rebounds as Maine would have (25).

The homecoming for Maine’s Kevin Little, a Wyandanch, N.Y. product, did not go as well as he had hoped. Averaging 20 points per game over his last five contests, Little would pour in just seven on 2-for-12, as the game was winding down and well out of reach.

SBU now has an overall record of 17-10 this season, and is 8-4 in America East play.

Next up for the Seawolves is a collision with the Albany Great Danes on Tuesday night at SEFCU Arena at 7 p.m.]]></content:encoded>

The Stony Brook baseball team opened its 2015 season with a three-game road trip to Thibodeaux, L.A. to take on the Nicholls State Colonels.

After taking game one in shutout fashion, the Seawolves slipped in game two, committing three errors before getting trounced in the rubber match due to offensive troubles again.

In Friday afternoon’s matchup, the season-opener for both teams, it was all Tyler Honahan for the Seawolves, as he was able to dominate the Colonels lineup.

He retired the first 13 batters he faced before walking right fielder Alex Shermer on a full count. The no-hitter was gone two batters later, when second baseman Tanner Vandevere laced a single up the middle.

The Pitcher of the Year candidate started his campaign strong, going six innings while only allowing three NSU batters to reach base while striking out three and only walking two.

The Seawolves seized the lead in the second inning, courtesy of Jack Parenty. The junior drove a base hit to left, the first of the two he would have in the game, and that brought home Andruw Gazzola from third.

Bobby Honeyman tried to score from second, but was tagged out at the plate on a great throw by left fielder Gavin Wehby. Stony Brook scored again in the third, as Johnny Caputo was able to reach on an error by Vandevere, allowing Robert Chavarria to score from third and double the lead to 2-0.

The game was blown open in the fifth, and newly-transformed catcher Cole Peragine is responsible. He roped a two-run double down the right field line, bringing home Parenty and Chavarria to make it 4-0.

Peragine then scored two batters later on Caputo’s infield hit to make the score 5-0. Toby Handley crossed home plate on a wild pitch from Zach Thiac to give the Seawolves a 6-0 lead.

Matt Senk’s squad could not overcome three errors in Saturday’s game, as the defense robbed Nicholas DiEva and Edwin Corniel of three runs, all of which were unearned in a 4-1 loss to the Colonels.

It was a sloppy game all around, as the Colonels also committed three blunders. Parenty reached base because of an error and then scored because of another miscue by Nicholls State.

Starting pitcher Grant Borne committed the first fault, and then Parenty touched home after a misstep by shortstop Joey Morales. That was all the Seawolves wrote on the scoreboard, as NSU would score four unanswered runs.

Kyle Reese led off the bottom of the second with a triple to center, and scored one batter later as Shermer hit an infield single to tie the game at one. It was then the error-riddled seventh that cost Stony Brook the game, as the Seawolves committed two of their three errors in the inning. Justin Holt led off the inning with a single and would score off an error from Parenty in left field.

The error also advanced Knight, who would then score as well to make it 3-1. Wehby reached base and advanced to second on an error by Peragine, and would score two batters later.

Despite all of the defensive miscues behind him, DiEva fell victim and took the loss in the matchup, the first of his collegiate career.

Justin Sinibaldi shut down the Seawolves in the rubber match, only allowing four hits over six innings of work in a 10-0 victory for NSU.

Two early home runs off of Tim Knesnik gave the Colonels a 3-0 lead through three innings. A sixth-inning explosion put the game out of reach for Stony Brook.

The Seawolves will now move on to a three game set with Louisiana-Lafayette from Feb. 20-22.]]></content:encoded>

After coming away with an easy win over Manhattan in its season opener last weekend, the Stony Brook men’s lacrosse team looked to improve to 2-0 on Saturday when the team, traveled to Queens to take on St. John’s.

The Seawolves received a great game from junior attacker Brody Eastwood, but his efforts were not enough to help SBU avoid its first loss the year, as the Red Storm came away with a 13-8 victory.

The game initially looked like it could be another easy win for Stony Brook, as the Seawolves jumped out to 3-0 lead in the first quarter. Eastwood had two of his three goals in the opening 15 minutes.

The Red Storm scored its first goal two minutes into the second quarter on a goal by junior midfielder Chris Hughes.

Hughes’ goal was followed by a goal from senior attacker Stefan Diachenko, the first of his four. Stony Brook ended the half with goals by junior attacker Matt Schultz and Eastwood, which allowed the Seawolves to take a 6-4 lead into the intermission.

After senior midfielder Mike Rooney scored his second goal of the game two minutes into the third, the Red Storm responded with two goals of its own.

Schultz then scored his second goal of the game with 7:22 remaining in the third, extending SBU’s lead to 8-6. That was the last Seawolves score of the afternoon.

With less than two minutes to go in the third, the Red Storm started a 7-0 run, when redshirt junior James Bonanno found the back of the net.

Then freshman Jason DeBendictis tied up the contest before the end of the quarter. In the fourth, Diachenko scored three goals.

The Red Storm’s run was finally finished once junior attacker Eric DeJohn scored his second consecutive goal, making the game 13-8.

The high note for the Seawolves was definitely Eastwood, who collected his 18th hat trick of his career. Rooney and Schultz finished the game with two goals apiece. Stony Brook also went 3-of-5 on extra man opportunities.

The Seawolves will look to rebound in their next game this Friday at home against NJIT. After that, they will continue their home stand when they welcome Duke on Sunday.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_35448" align="alignleft" width="600"]<a href="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/BPJ_0525.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-35448" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/BPJ_0525-600x400.jpg" alt="Sabre proctor (No. 13) scored 13 points in the first half of Wednesday's game alone, when SBU played UMBC.

BASIL JOHN / THE STATESMAN[/caption]

The signs were evident. Sabre Proctor had just corralled a hard pass down low with one hand, proceeded to spin around a defender and put up a layup to extend the Stony Brook women’s basketball team’s early lead. The play, which only lasted a few seconds, seemed to resonate throughout the night as the Seawolves dominated every aspect of the game beating the UMBC Retrievers 74-41.

“Thought it was a great team win. We had a lot of different players contribute in a balanced scoring attack. I thought we played well offensively and defensively tonight,” Head Coach Caroline McCombs said.

The Seawolves now own their first three-game winning streak this season and wins in five of their last six games. The team has started to come together recently and it could not be at a better time.

With March only a few weeks away, it is a good sign to see them hit their stride with playoffs nearing closer and closer. The starting lineup, which consisted of Proctor, Christa Scognamiglio, Brittany Snow, Jessica Ogunnorin and Kori Bayne-Walker, has improved to a perfect 3-0 when starting the game on the court together.

Scognamiglio has enjoyed her increase in playing time and feels the team has a makeup that is tough to stop.

“We have really good and different types of components that work well together. We’re really good at sharing the ball and finding the open player making it hard to guard all five of us,” Scognamiglio said.

The difficulty in defending against this Seawolves team was on display Wednesday. As Proctor received double and triple teams down low, she was able to pass it out to a teammate for an open look.

Even when she was not down low, Proctor showed versatility by hitting some outside shots, going 3-3 behind the arc.

There was not much to dislike in the first half of Wednesday's game.

Stony Brook controlled the pace of the half, out-scoring UMBC 42-20 shooting 56.5 percent from the field. Needing only a few minutes to settle in, the Seawolves quickly built a lead thanks to Scognamiglio and Proctor.

Fulfilling her role as the usual point scorer, Proctor battled the double teams tallying 13 points in the half with 17 points on the night.

Proctor also had 11 rebounds earning her fifth double-double this year. A surprising player performance on Wednesday night was Scognamiglio, who continues to put on a show from behind the arc.

Hitting three three-pointers in the first half helped her match Proctor’s first-half total of 13 points.

She also was doing enough good things on the court tonight to compile a game high +34 plus-minus.

“Our team has been doing a really good job of sharing the ball and my team is finding me in the corner and open spots and I’m knocking down my shots,” Scognamiglio said.

With the lead and all the momentum, Stony Brook looked to keep playing the way they did in the first half. The Seawolves had the privilege to tap into some of the depth their team possesses in the second half, having Kristie Costantino lead at point guard for most of the second 20 minutes.

The Seawolves continued to score, putting up 32 points in the second half securing the win and improving to 7-4 in America East play. On Sunday, the Seawolves hit the road to take on Maine.

Despite a strong effort against one of the America East’s best teams, Stony Brook dropped the game 57-49, halting the Seawolves' win streak at three games.

An exciting and fast paced first half was countered by a second half that was riddled with fouls and slow play.

Stony Brook kept the game within two scores until the final minutes, when the team was forced to play the foul game to try and even the score.

Accurate free-throw shooting by Maine helped maintain their distance and go on to win the game.

Throughout the afternoon, Stony Brook took advantage of Black Bear miscues and carelessness with the ball. The Seawolves capitalized on those turnovers whereas the Black Bears failed to do so, giving Stony Brook an 18-4 lead on points off Maine turnovers.

The advantage off turnovers was not enough against the best defense in the conference, though.

Consistent scoring and encouraging possessions are needed to overcome a team like Maine and on Sunday, it was not there for the Seawolves.

Proctor, Stony Brook’s top scorer, felt the defensive strength of Maine as she was held to just three points, an uncommon sight for the Stony Brook faithful.

With Proctor unable to find her shot Sunday afternoon, it was necessary for her teammates to step up if they wanted a chance at winning.

Scognamiglio, Bayne-Walker and Snow all did their best to fill in for the offense Proctor typically brings.

Scognamiglio followed up on her impressive performance from a few days ago by scoring a team-high 14 points and hitting four threes.

Trailing Scognamiglio in scoring was Bayne-Walker, who put an offensive twist on her play, dropping a total of 12 points.

Bayne-Walker also had a game-high five assists and got to the foul line five times, hitting four of her free-throws. Maine was powered by guard Sigi Koizar and forward Liz Wood.

Koizar put up a game-high 21 points with five rebounds and hit nine free-throws on 10 attempts.

Wood scored a double-double recording 17 points and 10 rebounds all of which were defensive rebounds.

Stony Brook will come right home, as the Seawolves will play UMass-Lowell on Wednesday, Feb. 18 at 7 p.m.

This will be the second meeting of the season between the two teams, the first ending with a Stony Brook victory, 64-60.

The Seawolves will hope to keep a hold of third place in the conference with a win Wednesday, as they are tied with the Hartford Hawks, each with 7-5 records.]]></content:encoded>

<em><strong>Point #1: Perimeter prowess will be key for Stony Brook men’s basketball.</strong></em>

On Saturday, the Stony Brook men’s basketball team defeated Maine in dominant fashion thanks in large part to its 11 three-point field goals.

Six of the 11 three-pointers were made by freshmen small forward Roland Nyama. He made six of his eight tries from deep and shot 9-12 overall.

Nyama’s shooting has played a large role in the Seawolves success during conference play.

In the four Seawolves conference losses, Nyama has missed all nine of his three-point attempts.

In the eight conference victories, Nyama has made 16 of 24 three point attempts (66 percent).

So far, coach Steve Pikiell has started four different players at the shooting guard position but has never wavered from his confidence in starting Nyama at small forward.

If the Seawolves want a chance at making a run deep into the America East playoffs, they will need consistent shooting from the perimeter.

More specifically, they will need Nyama to continue his hot streak of shooting into March.

<em><strong>Point #2: Stony Brook women’s basketball taking care of business against weaker opponents. </strong></em>

The Stony Brook women’s basketball team has yet to come away with a real statement win in conference play this season.

The Seawolves are 1-5 in games against America East opponents, with conference records over the .500 mark.

Despite not being able to beat some of the conference’s top teams, SBU still finds themselves in third place in the America East conference.

The reason for this is that Stony Brook has peformed extremely well against some of the conference’s weaker foes.

The Seawolves have beaten UMBC (4-8 conference record) and Vermont (2-11) twice this season, and also came away victorious in their matchups against UMass-Lowell (5-8) and Binghamton (2-11).

Beating up on weaker teams will likely allow Stony Brook to enter the America East championship with a higher seed, but once the tournament begins, there will be no getting around beating the conference’s top teams.

<em><strong>Point #3: Strong effort on the offensive glass continues to be crucial for SBU men’s team.</strong> </em>

In typical Stony Brook fashion, the Seawolves out-rebounded their two opponents this week by large margins (41-20, 52-28).

Most impressively, in both contests, the Seawolves were able to rebound over 40 percent of opportunities on the offensive glass.

In Saturday’s contest against Maine, power forwards Rayshaun McGrew and Tyrell Sturdivant combined for 22 rebounds with 13 of them coming on offense.

With an offense that has struggled to shoot the ball on a consistent basis, it will be key for the Seawolves to create additional opportunities on offense.

Unfortunately for the Seawolves, their next opponent, Albany, has allowed opponents to rebound only 25.5 percent of opportunities on the offensive side, which is 13th best in the nation.

If the Seawolves want to have a chance this Tuesday, look for McGrew to have a big game, as he was able to grab six offensive rebounds in Stony Brook’s last meeting against the Great Danes.

<em><strong>Point #4: Scognamiglio’s offense providing major boost for Seawolves.</strong> </em>

Coming into this season Head Coach Caroline McCombs knew she had three players in Sabre Proctor, Brittany Snow and Kori Bayne-Walker that could be counted on to carry the scoring load for the Seawolves night in and night out.

But this season, Scognamiglio has also emerged as an offensive threat for Stony Brook. Scognamiglio is averaging 7.7 points per game this season, and has a team-high 34 percent field goal percentage from three-point range. Her 1.6 three point field goals made per game is the sixth highest total in the America East conference this season.

Since conference play began on Jan. 3, her numbers have been even more impressive. She is averaging 11.5 points per game in the team’s 11 matchups against America East opponents this season.

Scognamiglio has shot 46 percent in conference games, which is tied for the eight best percentage in the America East this season. She has also shot 39 percent from behind the arc in conference play, which is the fourth best percentage in the America East this season.

Scognamiglio’s development as an offensive force for the Seawolves is not only important for the team’s chances this year, but for the program’s success moving forward.

UNIVERSAL PICTURES / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE" width="600" height="251" /></a> According to Deadline.com "Fifty Shades of Grey" made $80 million opening weekend. It is based on E.L James' book of the same name and debuted during Valentine's Day weekend. <em>UNIVERSAL PICTURES / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1">Even as a book, “Fifty Shades of Grey” is a bizarre project. Author E.L. James’ novel originated as “Twilight” fan-fiction and eventually spiraled into a self-published e-book before turning into the cultural phenomenon we know it as today.</p>
<p class="p1">Suffice to say, a “Fifty Shades of Grey” movie was inevitable. As a film, “Fifty Shades” works as a strong examination of cultural and cinema as a medium, but it is a shame the movie itself is terrible.</p>
<p class="p1">“Fifty Shades” follows Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson), a college senior who, through random circumstance, ends up interviewing young billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) for a school paper.</p>
<p class="p1">The two click during the interview and begin pursuing each other, with Christian quickly beginning to impose his dominant nature upon the young woman. Once the two have sex, Christian’s desires are revealed making the rest of the film a series of sexual activities and watching Christian trying to convince Anastasia to allow him to tie her up, whip her and simply control her.</p>
<p class="p1">There are almost no other incidents or plotlines beyond this. We are introduced to other characters—Christian’s family, Anastasia’s family and roommate—but they neither add nor advance any element of the film.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is because the film’s script is absolutely awful.</p>
<p class="p1">The film is incredibly boring, with nothing actually happening in the last half of it.</p>
<p class="p1">Once the courtship begins, the movie becomes a repetitive sequence of scenes where the dominant tries to make the former-virgin his submissive.</p>
<p class="p1">This is done by Anastasia’s character having dialogue consisting almost entirely of questions, to which Christian explains S&amp;M sub-culture to her.</p>
<p class="p1">This lack of compelling character and narrative drama would not be bad if the film actually made the sex particularly sexy.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Fifty Shades’” sex scenes barely exist. In total we are shown three major sex scenes that barely touch upon true S&amp;M desires, and frankly, are not very interesting. It treats sex as a taboo, trying to shy away from having to visually show the act. </span></p>
<p class="p1">Sure we see some skin and a surprising amount of pubic hair, but the film does not make any of it sexy or fun.</p>
<p class="p1">It simply exists.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Yet, where the sex scenes fail to stimulate any sort of sense of arousal, they do work as strong examinations of fourth-dimensional cinema. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Where the film shies away from showing any sort of sexual climax, the film creates a sense of euphoria within its audience through its structure. </span></p>
<p class="p1">There is an audience-wide wave of release of “finally they are banging” once the deed begins. While the content between the sex scenes is awful, it structurally works as a build-up to this climax. For example, Christian shows Anastasia his “play room” early on in the film, but we do not actually use it for another hour, it is essentially being shown to tease and titillate viewers. In this sense, the film is structured to replicate the feeling of sex.</p>
<p class="p1">We desire it, we build up to it, we achieve it and then we climax.</p>
<p class="p1">Visually, the film is shot in order to reflect the dominant nature of its male lead.</p>
<p class="p1">Slow, controlled aerial shots give a sense of looming and power on every scene with some pretty strong use of lighting.</p>
<p class="p1">There is one scene in particular involving a business meeting that is beautifully shot that it seems like it belongs in a different movie. While none of the actual content we are watching on screen is interesting, director Sam Taylor-Johnson sure makes it look good.</p>
<p class="p1">“Fifty Shades of Grey” is a bad movie, but it is a movie that knows exactly what it is—a Valentine’s Day date film.</p>
<p class="p1">One gets the feeling that elements like the acting, story and script were sacrificed for the sex scenes, but they are so lifeless that it simply breaks the film.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">Visually and structurally strong but lacking in all other areas, “Fifty Shades of Grey” is a mess of a film, but would we want it any other way?</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When someone goes to the Charles B. Wang Center and gets a selection of Vietnamese pressed sandwiches, muffins, tea infused scones, cupcakes or several choices of tea, they have found the new Jasmine Tea House.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Tea House was added to Jasmine during winter break. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I like this better, it’s cleaner it’s fresher, it’s newer, it’s just like a different feel,” Shawna Burke, a junior political science major, said about working at the new Tea House as opposed to her old job at Jasmine in the kitchen. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Angela M. Agnello, director of Marketing and Communications of the Faculty Student Association, said, “The Jasmine Tea House is providing an opportunity to expand student employment opportunities.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">During the winter break, student employees began training for the new teahouse. They learned how to make certain foods, which include the pressed sandwiches, muffins, frozen yogurt and more.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">“Student staff are being trained as ‘tea sommeliers,’ learning how to steep teas at optimal time and temperature and to prepare recipes for the new food and beverages available at the Jasmine Tea House,” Agnello said.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Students working at the Tea House tried approximately 28 tea samples during their training.</p>
<p class="p1">They have also sampled each of the pastries offered at the Tea House in order to assist customers.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">“Everybody says that the cinnamon scones are the bomb,” Burke said. </span></p>
<p class="p1">Jenny Wong, a junior health science major, who also works at the Tea House, said that the chai cupcakes sell out frequently.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Although this area in the Wang Center already has a place to get bubble tea, Faculty Student Association decided to put together a new larger area with a different variety of tea.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">All of the different teas can be made iced or hot. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">FSA also added a new sushi station and an additional spot for hot Asian entrees with a cash register for speed service.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Some students still go to the Jasmine Tea House for bubble tea.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Doria Canino, a junior marine biology major, said, “What I like is the bubble tea, it’s my particular choice of tea.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">“I really like it and I usually come here twice a week,” Canino said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I saw it on Tuesday after I transferred here.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">The cost of the Jasmine Tea House project was approximately $800,000. It included the equipment, project design and the new sushi and tea bar additions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">The Jasmine Tea House is currently operated by Lackmann Culinary Services. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> “At this time, we are unaware of any upcoming changes at the management for the Jasmine Tea House next semester,” Agnello said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">The Jasmine Tea House is open Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. It is also open Saturday through Sunday from 12 p.m. to 8 p.m.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

The Stony Brook women's basketball team is looking to rebound from a 57-49 loss to Maine in its upcoming pair of home games against UMass-Lowell and Albany this week.

In their last matchup against the River Hawks (11-14, 5-8 AE), the Seawolves were able to come away with a close 64-60 win. Senior Sabre Proctor put up an impressive 22 points and grabbed eight rebounds, including two key layups during the final two minutes of the game to put the Seawolves ahead. Junior Brittany Snow scored 17 points and hauled in nine rebounds of her own. Sophomore Christa Scognamiglio put up 13 points.

The Seawolves were able to put up better numbers than the River Hawks almost entirely across the board during their first matchup. Stony Brook outscored UMass-Lowell in the paint 46-30, and the Seawolves shot 43.5 percent from the field, compared to the River Hawks’ 42.9 percent. Both teams were 27.3 percent on three-point shots.  In order to have a successful game this time, the Seawolves will have to attack the paint as much as they did in the first matchup. If they can dominate the paint, they will be able to control the flow of the game.

In the Seawolves’ first game against conference rival Albany (18-7, 11-1 AE), Stony Brook fell just short of an impressive comeback, losing 69-59. After being down 54-34 during the second half, SBU closed the gap to 60-53 with just over three minutes left to play. Scognamiglio had a career night, scoring 19 points including five three-pointers. Senior Jessica Ogunnorin also had a big game for the Seawolves, putting up 16 points and three rebounds.

The Great Danes out-rebounded the Seawolves 31-27 on the game. Stony Brook had 22 offensive rebounds, while Albany only grabbed 16. From the field, the Seawolves out-shot Albany, scoring on 21 of 42 shots (50 percent) while Albany made 23 of 55 shots (41.8 percent).

One of the most important things for Stony Brook to focus on is turnovers. In the last game, Albany scored a whopping 33 of their 69 total points on turnovers. If the Seawolves can maintain possession of the ball for longer and make those possessions count, the game will surely be in their favor. Another important focus of the game is free throws. The Great Danes were 22 for 31 from the line, while Stony Brook was only nine for 11.

The Seawolves will square off against UMass-Lowell on Wednesday, Feb. 11 at 7 p.m.. The Seawolves' game against Albany is on Sunday, Feb. 22 at 4 p.m. Both games are at home in Island Federal Credit Union Arena.]]></content:encoded>

Following a week in which they topped the conference’s two weakest teams, the Seawolves (17-10, 8-4) look to keep rolling as they had into the second-to-last week of the regular season.

First on the docket will be a collision with the Albany Great Danes (18-7, 12-0) on Tuesday night at 7 p.m. from SEFCU Arena.

The Great Danes have won all but three of their conference games by double-digits, showcasing how dominant they have been during this 2014-15 season.  When they came to Stony Brook back on Jan. 19, they handedly took care of the Seawolves, with a final score of 64-47.

In order to slow the relentless Albany assault, the Seawolves will have to zero in on the dynamic scoring tandem of Mike Rowley and Evan Singletary.  To add to their concerns, leading scorer (14.2 points per game) Peter Hooley has returned from his leave of absence.  He has scored in double figures in 15 of the 16 games he has played this year.

With the America East Tournament being structured to favor the higher-seeded teams with home games, the road to the NCAA Tournament almost surely runs through Albany and its undefeated record.

The second game of the week will happen Saturday night at 7 p.m. at home against the Binghamton Bearcats (4-24, 3-10).

Painfully young are the Bearcats, who have just a single senior on their roster, one of whom has played only 33 minutes all year.  Their top three leading scorers are all freshman. In addition, they will be without Dusan Perovic, their leading scorer who had surgery to repair a torn right ACL.

When these two last met on Jan. 25, it took a career-high 27 points from Carson Puriefoy to help the Seawolves pull out the victory. Despite their 4-24 overall record, do not look for Stony Brook to take them lightly as they know a potential matchup in the America East Tournament looms.<strong> </strong>

After its run to the College World Series in 2012, Stony Brook Baseball looks to get back to the NCAA Tournament this season after getting bounced in its past two seasons.

“We knew we were going to lose guys to the draft [in 2012],” Stony Brook manager Matt Senk said. “We didn’t know we were going to lose seven.”

The following season, Stony Brook finished fourth in the America East and was knocked out by Maine after posting a 1-2 record in the conference tournament.

Last season, the Seawolves had two chances to win the tournament title, but Binghamton took both games, including a 13 inning thriller in the winner-take-all matchup to take their second-straight conference tournament title.

“Binghamton played very well. We had a very good team, but Binghamton played very well,” Senk said.

Casey Baker was a part of that team and struggled in those final games, going 2-for-9 as the Bearcats took the trophy.

“I can’t say here and say we lost that game,” the sophomore said.

Now, it is a new season and hope is looking up for Stony Brook, which returns six position players as well as America East Rookie of the Year Cameron Stone and an America East Pitcher of the Year Candidate Tyler Honahan.

The team was also picked to finish first in the America East’s preseason coaches' poll, as well as Baseball America and Perfect Game’s preseason conference rankings as well.

Safe to say, there is pressure on this team to get back to the NCAA Tournament in 2015.

“It’s a good thing. You can either embrace it, or be frightened by it,” Senk said. “We are someone who can win a championship and have a really great year.”

As far as the preseason awards go, the 25th-year manager says his team is looking past those.

“It’s more about the process,” the Cortland graduate said. “It’s very much appreciated, but the stuff at the end is what it’s about.”

It may be a cliché, but the season is a marathon, not a sprint. And the marathon begins with a very tough non-conference schedule, starting with Nicholls State from Feb. 13-15 and then playing two regional hosts from a season ago in Louisiana-Lafayette and Florida.

“Those are the ones we definitely look forward to,” Baker said. “Those are the big trips.”

The Ronkonkoma native also added that one of the best feelings he has had was beating USC last season, another big school which resides in the Pac-12 conference.

“That’s why you come here. You want to play those big teams. There’s nothing like it,” the utility player said.

The Gators (eight) and Ragin' Cajuns (one) have combined for nine trips to Omaha and the College World Series, and Senk knows to be the best, you have to beat the best.

"To be competitive and to do things at the highest level of baseball, you have to play the teams that have been there,” the Seawolves head man stated. “Once you get to a regional, you’re in a comfort zone that you would not have been in had you not played those teams.”

The Seawolves also have two Big East members on the schedule, hosting the Creighton Blue Jays on March 20-22, and then heading to the nation’s capital to take on Georgetown from April 18-19.

“You can never have big wins without big games,” Senk said. Stony Brook certainly has a lot of those on their 2015 slate, and the Seawolves' first conference matchup will be big as well: a three-game set against the defending champion Binghamton Bearcats at home from March 14-15.

With all of these big games on the schedule, the big question for Stony Brook coming into the season will be its pitching staff, which features seven newcomers.

“Being a freshman is always tough enough,” Senk said. “It’s always a little bit tougher on the freshman because of the non-conference schedule we have.”

But, according to Baker, it soon just turns back into baseball.

“The level of competition isn’t close to anything they have seen before,” he said. “But once you get used to it, the natural feeling of ‘I’ve been doing this for 20 years’ kicks back in.”

As far as potential freshman standouts, Senk pointed to pitcher Nicholas DiEva and infielder Bobby Honeyman as potential candidates.

“We knew [DiEva] had a good arm, but his secondary stuff has been really good,” the manager praised about his Cherry Hills East graduate.

As for the man from Massapequa?

“He’s shown some very nice things offensively and that’s always nice to see,” Senk said about Honeyman.

All freshman have the potential for a big impact, especially with only three pitchers being set in stone, with Ryley MacEachern joining the group of Honahan and Stone. But once the America East schedule starts March 14, they will all be ready.

“They couldn’t have played anybody tougher in the conference than we played out of conference,” Senk said, again refering to the very tough non-conference slate, something he has prided himself on since taking over the program in 1991.

He is looking to lead his squad back to the NCAA Tournament for the fifth time during his tenure, and the approach to doing so is very simple.

“If we do what we feel is a very sound approach to the game, and that is we make teams beat us and we don’t beat ourselves,” Senk said.

After a dominant regular season last year, the Seawolves will be looking to do the same. This time, they hope to finish the deal and make the tournament for the first time since 2012.

“We just have to do what we did last year,” Baker said.

Easier said than done, but talk to any member of that squad, and they will say it with the confidence like they are going to finish on top again this year. But this time, they will win it all and head back to the promised land.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Ontario-born Peragine continues to thrive at Stony Brook</title>

STATESMAN STOCK PHOTO" width="600" height="465" /></a> Cole Peragine has been an essential part of the baseball team's success. <em>STATESMAN STOCK PHOTO</em>[/caption]

How can it be that a town known for its ice, inside of a country known for the athletes it produces on ice, is responsible for producing one of the premier players Stony Brook baseball has seen since the turn of this century?

Roughly 575 miles (a 10-hour car ride) away from one another, Cole Peragine looks to make his journey from his hometown of Belle Ewart, Ontario, to Stony Brook, N.Y., appear as a seamless transition.

“The biggest thing to get used to is living on your own,” Peragine said as his eyes narrowed and his lips pursed at the corners, “that and the level which the game is played.”

No one could blame Peragine for having to get accommodated to living on his own, let alone having to simultaneously deal with the rigors of being a major Division I college athlete.  On top of that, he was not just transitioning from a different state, but a different nation.

The fallacy of Americanism is that we sometimes have the concept that stereotypes are guilty until proven innocent.  In this case, how could a young man from Canada, seemingly the hockey capital of the world, find his way onto a baseball diamond?

“I really only just played street hockey growing up,” Peragine said as his smile indicated that he had answered this before and was no stranger to folks thinking he was bound for a life on skates, not cleats.

“Heading into my freshman year [of high school], that’s when I knew,” Peragine said concerning his future in baseball. “I knew I would have to put in the work, and that coming to the States was a real possibility.”

It is easy to imagine all six feet and 180-pounds of Peragine shoveling out the snow around the shortstop position on a sandlot, with his own personal Mr. Miyagi feeding him knowledge of Honus Wagner, Ernie Banks, Derek Jeter and other legendary shortstops of days gone by.

For Peragine, that mentor was his father.

“[I] remember him always hitting me ground balls, working on me with my fielding,” Peragine said.

Those countless hours spent with no eyes trained on him but those of his father have turned Peragine into not only a four-year D-I starter, but also a potential pro prospect.  Baseball America has Peragine ranked as the sixth best prospect within the America East Conference for the 2014-15 season.

In his freshman year, Peragine tasted the sweetest champagne at the table by making the College World Series in Omaha, Neb..  For any player at any school in the entire nation to accomplish such a feat is an incredible achievement, but to do it your first year on campus at a school that had to overcome incredible obstacles just to get to that point, it seems almost improbable.

“Our goal is definitely to get back there [Omaha],” Peragine said, “and that all starts with winning our conference.”

During his sophomore and junior seasons, Peragine started in 107 games for Stony Brook. He followed up his rookie campaign with another strong season, in which he batted .289, and struck out only once every 10.1 at-bats. Last season he ranked top ten in the conference in runs scored (34), RBIs (36), walks (31), triples (four) and stolen bases (13).

When you’re as talented at something as Peragine is at baseball, it’s difficult to see a life beyond it.  Although he’s never pulled in a check worth six figures, Peragine still believes the dream can last forever.  What about life beyond the diamond though, once it’s all over?

“I can see myself becoming a firefighter,” Peragine said.

While Peragine’s future may consist of putting out fires, he looks to light one in the Seawolves this season and lead them back to the College World Series.]]></content:encoded>

The previously mentioned sex toy and I had a wonderful relationship for almost a year, but we both knew it could never last. We were both young and needed to move on to better and newer models. We parted on good terms and he will always be remembered fondly in my heart as “my first.”

I really hope after reading that ridiculous story, you realize why the concept of a hymen signifying virginity is absolutely ridiculous.  So, if a hymen does not define virginity, what does?

I’m going to go a little outside the box (pun completely intended) and say this crazy concept of virginity is as expansive and ever-changing as Kim Kardashian’s butt.

Consider a few different scenarios.  Was young Kate not a virgin because her hymen was no longer intact? Is a girl whose first sexual encounter is rape not a virgin?  Is a man who performs oral sex on every blonde woman in his town still a virgin?  Is someone who engages with intercourse exclusively with inanimate objects or themselves considered a virgin?  Is a woman who is impregnated using in vitro fertilization without having intercourse a virgin?  The concept of virginity is completely obsolete in society today. I am urging all of you to consider that virginity is a state of mind, not a state of hymen. Your virginity is only as real as you decide it to be.

The concept of virginity is very archaic by nature, especially considering the social atmosphere of where we live. Men and women alike can walk around New York completely topless, and yet we are still convinced of this idea that virginity and your first sexual experience is something special, while the next 382 experiences are just practice. We don’t consider our first time with anything else a special moment to be shared only with someone deserving, although I was excited about dying my hair for the first time.

Imagine if you had to spend six months with a Taco Bell beefy crunch burrito before you could finally try it because you needed to know it really well before you could enjoy it. People don’t light candles and play soft music for the first time they put in a tampon and consider that pretty similar to sex. No one has ever said no to going to Disney World because they really wanted to only watch Disney movies for a few years, preferring to suffer with 2-D Cinderella instead of living in her castle.

Sex is the only thing that gets so much emphasis for the first experience. People are supposed to preserve their first sexual experience for someone special because apparently only someone who loves you should be allowed to revel in the sexual awkwardness of a body new to sex. To be honest, if I loved someone, I would want to save them from that uncomfortable encounter so they could skip straight to the pro moves. And when you think about it, which is really more fun: sex or a hymen?

The real story of how I lost my virginity is equally as anticlimactic as the first story. We were under the stars, bathed in moonlight, while we were enveloped in soft Florida grass and the sounds of cicadas kept us company in the background. This is all just a really fancy way of saying outside next to a bush.

Maybe your first time was behind a bush, or next to a tree on a farm. Maybe your roommate interrupted to get his weed stash or you had to throw your tampon in the neighbor’s yard because you were too embarrassed to admit you had your period. Maybe you even lost it to me your junior year or with the love of your life who ended up cheating on you. And maybe, virginity isn’t really something you lose, but instead a really funny story you gain.]]></content:encoded>

Galentine’s Day. You may have heard the term tossed around while walking through Starbucks or browsing on Tumblr during lecture but never actually had it explained. Well, I am here to shed some light on that definition and explain not only what Galentine's Day, is but why it is the greatest non-official holiday.

I first heard of Galentine’s Day during one of my many Saturday afternoon “Parks and Rec” marathons. If you do not follow the show, like you should, “Parks and Rec’s” main character, Leslie Knope, created a holiday on Feb. 13 that is dedicated to the celebration of ladies. On the show, it is an annual holiday where Leslie and her closest girlfriends leave their husbands and boyfriends behind and spend the day gossiping and eating breakfast foods. As described by Leslie, “it’s like Lilith Fair minus the angst plus frittatas.” And it truly is the best day ever.

Why is it great? Galentine’s Day is a day by the ladies, for the ladies. It is not about being single, engaged, married or in any kind of relationship, it is about girl time. During the crazy lovey-dovey time of cheesy Hallmark cards and stabby, expensive red roses, Galentine’s Day is a breath of fresh air. No boyfriends. No husbands. No stuffy dinner dates. Just a group of girlfriends and a box of wine.

And let’s face it, the one thing about Valentine’s Day that I think should be subject to change is the men. Men are late to pick us up, they forget to make the reservations, they make you buy the condoms. Galentine’s Day is, in some ways, the improved Valentine’s Day: remove the men, but keep the chocolate and alcohol.

After my first encounter with Galentine's Day, I never went back. I mean don’t get me wrong, I love Valentine’s Day. Deep down, I truly am a hopeless romantic looking for my Prince Charming on a white horse, but a day of gossip with my friends is a magical affair. Last year, my girlfriends and I went out to the Cheesecake Factory for our Galentine’s Day. When we got to the restaurant, the lobby was crammed full with couples, all packed like sardines shoulder to shoulder waiting for a table. The wait for a table of two was an hour and a half, but for a round table of ten awesome ladies, we waited five minutes. Snaps for Galentine’s Day perks.

And do not be mistaken, this is not a celebration of single lady status, it is a toast to sisterhood. It is our spa day, our once a year needed break to grab our lady-buddies and hit the town because the wine is cheap and the clubs are discounted for the big next day of Feb. 14. As Leslie Knope once said, “February 14th is about romance. but February 13th, Galentine’s Day, is about celebrating lady friends.”

Valentine’s Day is about love, so spend your holiday with the person you love the most. Maybe you will find it somewhere in the dark basement of a frat house that night or maybe you will spend it with that special someone. But before you do so, do not forget your girlfriends. I truly cannot think of a proper way to really thank my girlfriends for being so amazing to me even when I am a true terror, but I will start with a marathon of Nicholas Sparks movies and a pillow fort competition and go from there.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Feline friends manage Stony Brook cat quagmire</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_35614" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-35614 size-medium" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_4986-e1424222680407-600x450.jpg" alt="IMG_4986" width="600" height="450" /> Most cats, like Frosty, above, prefer the protection and seclusion of the woods, while others roam around late at night. <em>PHOTO CREDIT : STEPHANIE MARTONE</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1">Before 2002, Stony Brook was the crazy cat lady of Long Island—hundreds of stray cats roamed the campus, and there was no plan in place to take care of them all.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Along came Nancy Franklin, Ph.D., a professor of psychology and director of the master’s program at Stony Brook, who one day felt destined to serve a furry face.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“It all started when I saw a cat looking at me by the Administration building on my walk to my car,” Franklin said. “It just dawned on me…something has to be done about this problem.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The problem Franklin talked about was not only the stray cat population, but also the handling of domesticated cats by students.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">“People have this idiotic view to send cats off and think, ‘With their instincts they’ll be fine,’” Franklin said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So she began to draw up her own plan for a trap, neuter, return program. After sending a letter to then-university President Shirley Kenny, a few faculty members caught word of the project and jumped on.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One early member was Rita Reagan-Redko, an undergraduate advisor in the Department of Technology and Society who currently directs the student network.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I joined shortly after it started, and when Nancy asked me to take over the feeding duties, I said sure,” she said. A cat-lover as well, Reagan-Redko noticed this problem long before joining the project.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I came back to [Stony Brook] in the 90s, and I was appalled at how many cats I saw on campus,” Reagan-Redko said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With growing student interest in helping and Franklin’s classroom recruiting techniques, the SBU Cat Network was soon born.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Today, the Cat Network is a fully recognized university organization, feeding the cats, building the cats shelters, and tending to their medical needs.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Franklin was keen on repeating the phrase “grassroots organization” to describe the SBU Cat Network.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Senior Stephanie Martone is the current president. She stressed the cooperation and compassion needed to help the cats.</span></p>
<p class="p1">“Whether faculty or student, we have someone to take care of them every day of the year,” said Martone. “Even summer and winter when school is not in session for most students.”</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The group even frequently gathers money out-of-pocket to pay for expensive veterinarian procedures.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Both Martone and Franklin said that there were at least 350 cats on campus in 2002. Since then, the SBU Cat Network has helped get that number down to under 100 through adoption and population control.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you have not had the experience of seeing a cat at Stony Brook, the reason is twofold.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We still have a lot of cats on campus, but a lot of them are hidden and they know where the shelters are so they only move around at night,” said SBU Cat Network member and junior biology major Stephen Chan.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The other reason is that many cats are “feral,” as opposed to stray.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to the Last Hope Animal Rescue website, “A feral cat is primarily wild-raised or has adapted to feral life, while a stray cat is often someone’s pet that has become lost or has been abandoned.” Feral cats are much more afraid of humans, while strays, who still have domestic tendencies, tend to hover near human dwellings like garages or backyards.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But while Stony Brook may have been a feral hub, the problem is not Long Island, but college life itself.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“A lot of students think they can have cats in their rooms, but then they find out, usually from an RA, that they actually can’t have one,” SBU Cat Network member Maddy Marcus, a junior journalism major, said. “Then they just find some woods and let it run out.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Alleycat.org says that programs similar to this have been successfully implemented on campuses like Stanford University, Auburn University, Texas A&amp;M at College Station, Arizona State University and more.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As for working on solving Stony Brook’s problem once and for all, SBU Cat Network member and junior psychology major Shannon Fitzgerald says it is a "see something, say something" effort for students.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“If students say something like, ‘We saw a cat near Javits,’ then we’d be in charge of building a sanctuary there,” Fitzgerald said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">More than once, the SBU Cat Network has been rewarded for its efforts by the Animal Rescue Site’s Shelter Challenge competition, earning top prizes and $1,000 grants.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“If you love or if you hate cats, you want to see this problem addressed,” Franklin said. “There’s nothing like the incredible and intense love of a rescued cat.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_35511" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-35511 size-full-width" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/sbu_housing2-600x284.png" alt="sbu_housing2" width="600" height="284" /> The StarRez system is the new all-in-one system students will be using for their housing needs, starting summer 2015. Campus Residences currently uses five different systems to facilitate housing selection. <em>BRIDGET DOWNES / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stony Brook is stepping up its game when it comes to streamlining the housing process, looking to use an all-in-one system, StarRez.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"> Currently, Campus Residences uses five different systems for the housing process. It uses Facebook for roommate matching, SOLAR for room selection, the Campus Residences website for waiting lists, Summer Conference Housing as a separate system, and the Room Management System to track housing information.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">“StarRez will allow us to consolidate all these processes and related correspondences in one system,” Assistant Director of Information Technology for Campus Residences Henry Joseph said. “The resident will have a central portal that they can log into for all their housing needs.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Starting Summer 2015, students will use StarRez for their housing needs. This Online Housing System was created to help students to select housing more easily because some experienced problems in the past.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> “I feel like it’s unnecessarily complicated because of the process they have set up,” sophomore biomedical engineering major Jason Iannelli said of the current system. “And also their servers can’t handle the influx of students all trying to pick their rooms at the same time.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Students will be able to sign in with their NetID and get updates sent to them electronically regarding their housing status, notifications, reminders, finances and new applications with little or no staff involvement, according to a Division of Information Technology newsletter.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4"> Campus Residences is sponsoring the initiative, and DoIT is assisting with its implementation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> “This will make everything housing related more intuitive and decrease any confusion on where to go to complete a process or application,” Joseph said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4"> Although Campus Residences were not getting complaints from students about the current system, every year some students missed the Online Room Selection process or did not understand how to complete it, Joseph said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Having everything in a single streamlined system will decrease confusion and simplify our housing processes for the residents,” Joseph said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Students experienced crashes in the system as well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> “It comes down to how lucky are you to pick your room before the servers crash, and it leaves a lot of students out in the cold,” Iannelli said. “I didn’t know about this new system coming out, but I am very happy to hear about it. I would like to see the system improved.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> According to the DoIT newsletter, OHS will have an integrated messaging system so staff can quickly communicate with students if necessary via system messages, email or text messages.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> StarRez also offers new features. Students will be able to see the location of a room before selecting it, as well as lock and hold a space while deciding using a new “ticket-master system.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> This feature will allow students not to worry that someone else will pick the room they are viewing while actively looking at it. But students can only look at a room for a certain amount of time to prevent those from reserving a room with no intention of selecting it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> StarRez will also allow non-residents to sign up for the waiting lists.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

Andrew Cuomo is looking to mandate experiential learning, like internships and research, in order for students to graduate. Over 60 SUNY institutions would be affected by this plan.<br /><em>STATESMAN STOCK PHOTO</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gov. Andrew Cuomo is pushing for experiential learning through internships and/or part-time jobs as a new graduation requirement for all SUNY students in his proposed SUNY budget for next year.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Frederick Walter, the former president of the Stony Brook University Senate who currently serves on the SUNY Senate, said Stony Brook is ahead of the curve as the current Stony Brook Curriculum calls for experiential learning upon graduation; however, how the Governor describes experiential learning and how Stony Brook University does are completely different.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">The SBC asks that students at some point learn through experience, whether it be through internships, jobs, research, scholarly activity or service learning, among other experiences. Cuomo’s plan would mandate experiential learning through internships.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to Walter, an internship would definitely help a business or journalism major, but certain students would not benefit from working as an office intern, but they rather need experience in study labs doing research and experimentations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Issues with experiential learning being mandated by the Governor go beyond a lack of an explanation of exactly what experiential learning is. There are over 60 SUNY campuses, not counting CUNY schools, which also fall under the list of SUNY campuses.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As Walter pointed out, this mandate would be “a system-wide thing. There are 400,000 students in the SUNY system. It is huge...there aren’t enough companies in the state of N.Y. offering internships.” Not only that, but with over 60 unique schools, mandating the same requirements for all would be foolish, Walter said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stony Brook University professor and Director of the Center for News Literacy Dean Miller noted additional issues. Experiential learning should be a requirement “only if students have access to it” and “so many students can’t afford internships because so many of them are unpaid,” he said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In “Moving the New New York Forward,” Cuomo explains START-UP NY, “a game-changing initiative that is transforming SUNY campuses…into tax-free communities” with the goal to attract new businesses and offer them the opportunity to create new jobs—including paid college internships.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even with tax breaks creating paid positions, Miller said there will be an advantage to the rich for paid internship positions. The tax breaks are “a start... but making [experiential learning] a requirement is easy, and cheap and it doesn’t really solve the problem,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The problem is [the] student who is working two jobs just to get through school can’t afford to take an unpaid internship,” Miller said. Another issue is that although 1,300 new jobs may seem like progress, there are over 400,000 students in the SUNY system. This means there are potentially 400,000 students seeking jobs who otherwise would not be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Despite many groups offering paid spots, Miller said, “Organizations know that students need the experience, so they can get away with not paying.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Requiring all students to gain an internship would force certain disadvantaged students into picking up unpaid spots, which is “lunacy,” Miller said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Cuomo has faced opposition for trying to mandate this. Walter said many SUNY Senate members wonder why the governor is mandating curriculum, as no governor has done so previously. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cuomo is a politician not a professor, therefore he does not fully understand what he is mandating. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Governor’s Press Office did not comment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cuomo has also said he will withhold 10 percent of funding from SUNY campuses until they submit performance plans.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Campuses submit performance plans, which are set goals for a given year unrelated to the experiential learning mandate. If they do not submit the plans, the Governor will withhold 10 percent of funding, which would be approximately $15 million for Stony Brook.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">If Cuomo mandates that experiential learning be a graduation requirement, it will become the standard for SUNY campuses. He wants this mandate to go into effect as soon as possible. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cuomo hopes that experiential learning will be added as a graduation requirement as early as next year, which would affect most current SUNY students. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

The best part about the end of summer is that you can finally stop living off cantaloupe and flavored seltzer water and switch to binging on Nutella-covered Oreos because your inevitable winter weight will be well hidden under oversized sweaters, which will pass off as “slouchy.”

The best part about the end of Valentine’s Day is that you can finally stop going on dates with weirdos who never managed to master the correct use of your/you’re in the tedious search for someone to bring home to mom and dad during the holiday season.

Valentine’s Day marks the end of the seemingly endless string of holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year’s, Valentine’s Day) that most of us would prefer to not spend alone and an end to your parents questioning your sexuality because you didn’t bring a date home over winter break.  Because, for some reason, Netflix can’t count as my boyfriend.

Halloween is the dying cry of sexual freedom and celebrated singlehood. Even though you had a great time hooking up with your roommate’s friend on Halloween while dressed as Kim Possible (until you started throwing up that Four Loko), once the hangover subsides, it’s time to hang up the patent leather stilettos in favor of a beige cashmere turtleneck to hide the hickeys and search for that perfect, quiet boy with a matching religion to bring home for the holidays.

Those unlucky souls, present company included, who did not secure a mate, retreat into their carton of Ben and Jerry’s Phish Phood to be washed down with a bottle of Chianti through a straw, all while watching “Breaking Bad” with our cockapoo for the duration of Relationship Season.  It is in this pit we wallow until the heart-shaped boxes of chocolate are half-off.

Flash forward to Feb. 15: the day that hibernation ends. Sweet tranquility enfolds you as the commercials reminding you to buy something special for your nonexistent lover finally end, the teddy bears that say “I love you” finally stop mocking you from the shelf, Instagram will no longer be plastered with pictures of hearts made from rose petals and I can finally stop telling my parents that I’m not a lesbian, I’m just single.

Couples are the ones that now retreat into their dorm-sized bed together to look at property taxes in different parts of the country, and fold socks together because it’s now time for us singles to rule.

As the weather very, very slowly begins to warm, the Army of the Unattached comes out of hiding to spread our seed while our poor, coupled roommates will have to hear all the war stories of those we’ve conquered.  Those that must listen to the conquered tales of “That Guy I Met in CPR Class” and “The One that Failed Out of School,” will go to bed at night, head nestled in the crook of someone’s hairy armpit content, but secretly wondering about life on the other side of Valentine’s Day.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Konig Kolumn: 37 Down, many more to come</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We survived a summer of headline-grabbing and, in too many cases, deadly incidents that launched a polarizing national debate on race relations and police militarization. We survived the subsequent autumn of controversial judicial decisions that have led to outrage and even rioting. We survived these periods of chaotic tension only to realize a winter of racial discontent is upon us. The civil rights discussion has re-launched in full force and, to many, the nation seems to have begun to revert or stall instead of progressing into a 21st-century mindset.

That is a debate for another time and another forum. Rejoice, my fellow Americans, because while certain aspects of the Civil Rights movement may have hit a few bumps in the road, other aspects have made leaps and bounds, even as recently as the last few days. Specifically, the LGBTQ community has recently seen positive strides taken towards its standing in the eyes of governments across the United States. The advancement in terms of acceptance and legal rights for millions of non-heterosexual people in America has improved at an unprecedented rate.

As a straight, white teenage male, securely in the middle class, the relevancy of many of these debates over race and marriage may seem distant or inapplicable to my life. I have never felt the wrath of racial prejudice or feared oppression because of my sexuality. I have never felt the need to be wary of police while walking at night. I have never feared ridicule or persecution because of my sexuality. I have never feared that one day, my marriage to someone that I loved would not be recognized in the eyes of the law. The issues of the racial and sexual minority communities, on the surface, may not appear to be my issues.

But they are. They are all of our issues. In his “I Have a Dream” speech, Martin Luther King Jr. said, “their destiny is tied up with our destiny.” This was in reference to the “white brothers” who had marched to Washington, D.C. alongside the black people of King’s movement that late August day in 1963. These words, like many of his, still ring true today. All of our destinies are intertwined. If we, as Americans, and as human beings, cannot join together in support of our equal rights for all of our brethren, regardless of race, creed, religion or sexuality, then we do not truly exemplify humanity or embody the American spirit.

In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act into law. It was in response to a Hawaii Supreme Court case that brought attention to ambiguity in the federal government’s views on marriage. Politics and national consensus were different at the time. The country was not ready. Eight short years later in 2004, after the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that denial of same-sex marriage licenses violated the state constitution, marriages between same-sex couples were first recognized and upheld in any jurisdiction.

Today, just over a decade after the Massachusetts decision, thirty-seven total states recognize same-sex marriage thanks to legislative approvals, voting majorities and a furor of appeals courts decisions. Since the beginning of October of 2014, seventeen states, including Alabama just this past week, all began issuing same-sex or gender-neutral marriage licenses thanks to some legislative or judicial statute. You know when Alabama is not the last state to hop onto a civil rights bandwagon things are heading in the right direction. Next stop, Mississippi!

On top of the thirty-seven states (and the District of Colombia) that have approved same-sex marriage, there are twenty-one Native American jurisdictions and certain counties in Kansas and Missouri that have joined this rapidly-spreading recognition. West Virginia joined the party in October, but its LGBTQ anti-discrimination laws are notably weak and fail to protect against employment and housing discrimination based on sexuality. The minute town of Thurmond, W.V. decided to do something about its state government’s failures and passed a sweeping and much stricter ordinance accounting for all kinds of LGBTQ discrimination. All five residents of Thurmond approved the legislation.

In Oregon, Gov. John Kitzhaber will resign this Wednesday after balking on doing so several times. His Secretary of State, Kate Brown, will assume the governorship upon Kitzhaber’s resignation. In becoming Oregon’s 37th governor and second female governor, she will also become the United States’ first openly non-heterosexual governor. Brown is happily married to her husband, but has confirmed she is openly bisexual. This is far from Brown’s defining feature as a statesman, but it is still incredibly significant from a historical and societal perspective.

The most important news in recent months is the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to rule on the issue of same-sex marriage by June of this year. Perhaps it is a little late to the ballgame and perhaps not even necessary with the national trend of late, but all progress is good progress. Fighting state by state, jurisdiction by jurisdiction may no longer be necessary in four short months. Sure, the Supreme Court justices may only be taking this case to preserve their legacy and to say they didn’t avoid the issue for the entirety of their tenures, but who cares what their reasoning is if the end result provides a happy ending, or rather, a happy beginning to a new era?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_34649" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-34649 size-medium" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/3.25.12_BU_efal.sayed10-600x400.jpg" alt="STATESMAN STOCK PHOTO" width="600" height="400" /> The Seawolves softball team gears up for a new season after its devastating loss last spring to the Albany Great Danes. <em>STATESMAN STOCK PHOTO</em>[/caption]

It looked like any routine fly ball that Bria Green, left fielder, had to catch. Had she done so, both the game and the America East tournament would be over and the Seawolves softball team would advance to its second-straight NCAA tournament.

But Elizabeth Snow's off-the-bat ball just kept going until it ended up over the fence, breaking the hearts of the Stony Brook faithful and sending the Albany section into eruption.

The worst part? The Seawolves had to muster up the energy to play a second game, a winner-take-all match to decide the 2014 America East Championship. Albany’s momentum proved to be too much, with the Great Danes dominating Stony Brook 8-2 and taking the title.

“It’s not in the back of our minds. It’s in our minds,” senior Shayla Giosia said of the ending to the previous season.

Looking ahead, the Seawolves return the centerfielder along with Green, their power source from a year ago with 16 home runs. The Seawolves will also continue with their dynamic duo in the circle: senior Allison Cukrov, the reigning America East Pitcher of the Year, and junior Jane Sallen.

“They’re different and complement each other very well in terms of what they throw,” Megan T. Bryant, Stony Brook's Head Coach, said.

As for the roster, the Seawolves return 10 players from last season’s team. Only four of those players are seniors, with Diane Caruso joining Cukrov, Giosia and Green.

“It’s my last season, so of course I’m going all out,” Giosia said.

They may be few in numbers, but they have a big leadership group with four incoming freshmen.

“I think the leadership from those juniors and seniors will be the key to our success this season,” Bryant said.

The Seawolves lost two key seniors from last season’s team, shortstop Jessica Combs and third baseman Olivia Mintun. Big spots last season, but Bryant believes that losing the entire left side of the infield will not be a problem.

“Jessica and Olivia brought a lot to this program,” graduate of the University of Bridgeport said. “But I think we’re going to be really solid defensively.”

The young players coming into the team will get a to play a tough non-conference schedule before America East play begins on March 21 against UMass-Lowell.

Eight teams on the schedule finished last season in the top 100 in RPI and six of the squads on the slate made the NCAA Tournament in 2014.

“I know it gets us ready for America East play,” Bryant said. “We embrace [the tough schedule]. This has been a part of this program’s success over recent years.”

At the Seawolves’ first two tournaments of the season at Florida Gulf Coast and at North Florida, they will face four teams in the top 100 of RPI.

Purdue (No. 73) and FGCU (No. 90) await the Seawolves Feb. 20-22 in Fort Myers, Fla..

The next weekend at North Florida, Kansas and the NF Ospreys will face Stony Brook.

“Those teams may be tough, but we’re still expected to beat them and to prepare for conference,” Giosia said.

Both of those trips, along with a trip to James Madison, will give the Seawolves a chance to bond and get the chemistry up before the real gruel of the season begins.

“Everybody is excited to get out and see some sunshine,” Bryant said. “It really sets the tone for the rest of the season.”

The Seawolves will try and get back to the America East tournament this season, but this time, punch the ticket to the NCAA tournament for the second time in three years.

“We return the pieces to be able to do it,” Bryant said. “We have the pitching, we are one of the top defensive teams in the conference and we have the ability offensively to score a lot of runs.”

		<title>Head Coach Joe Spallina has high expectations for SBU women&#039;s lacrosse team</title>

If there is one thing to say about Stony Brook’s women’s lacrosse Head Coach Joe Spallina, he does not like to lose.

“I used to dream of success, now success is inadequate,” B.o.B. says in Stony Brook’s run-out song, “Bombs Away.”

It is as if those lyrics were made for this team. Spallina arrived on campus in June of 2011, with hopes of turning a losing program into a winner. The Seawolves have managed to do just that, enjoying their winningest season in program history in 2013 while following it up with the same number of wins, 17, in 2014.

Both seasons saw Stony Brook punch their ticket to the NCAA Tournament. On both occasions, they made the second round.

Against Syracuse, things were different. It was not that the Seawolves did not fight. The Orange simply did not give them a chance. They showed spurts in the second half of what Stony Brook’s lacrosse program could do against the very best in the nation, but there is still a step to take.

Somehow, in the middle of all of this success, there is a sense of disappointment. Spallina and his Seawolves know that they can be better. They want to be the very best, and they will not stop until they get to the very top of that mountain, a tough one to climb.

“Stony Brook stands out to me because they have done a great job changing the culture of the way their team runs in the past few years,” Michigan’s assistant coach, Alyssa Murray, said. Murray has a unique viewpoint in that she played on the Syracuse team that beat Stony Brook last spring and served as an assistant coach for the Seawolves this fall. “ They have gone from a team that was unranked and struggling to a major threat.”

A lot of that change in culture comes from their coach, who won multiple national championships while at Division II Adelphi. It is more than just creating schemes and calling out plays to the student-athletes.

“I know Coach Spallina and no one is more competitive than he is,” Greg Gurenlian, a professional lacrosse player and member of Team USA, said.

Day in and day out, he brings that passion to his team, and it shows.

Not very often do freshmen show enough of a competitive fire that it makes up for their lack of experience. That rare occurrence came in the form of Courtney Murphy, Dorrien Van Dyke and Kristin Yevoli.

The trio combined to contribute 45 percent of Seawolves points last season. 28 offensive players saw action for Stony Brook last season, and three of them owned 45 percent of the team’s goals and assists. That is unreal even for seniors or players with a lot of experience. Words cannot quite describe what that shows about the three stars with three seasons left to go.

The best part for the Seawolves is that they are not alone.

Over 90 percent of the team’s scoring returns this season, which makes Spallina’s thoughts about this year’s offense even that much more shocking.

“I think that you’ll see what will be a much more prolific offense this year,” Spallina said. “I think our offense will rival our defense as far as national respectability.”

That is bold to say, since last year, the Seawolves defense set a Division I record for scoring defense. It was not just an America East accomplishment. Stony Brook gave up only 5.33 goals per game, something no other team in the country had ever done.

So, what will make the offense that impressive this coming season?

Freshman Long Islander Kylie Ohlmiller of Islip High School is a good start. As a senior, she was named a U.S. Lacrosse All-American, but high school and the college game are totally different animals.

Her effort day in and day out at practice have shown Spallina otherwise, though.

“I think Kylie Ohlmiller will be the most prolific scorer in the freshman class in the country,” the head coach said. “Before she’s out of here she’ll be a very strong candidate to win the Tewaraaton, she’s that good.”

The Tewaraaton Award is given to the best player, period, in the entire country. For a coach who does not throw such compliments around without warranting, that is a huge statement.

Ohlmiller will at least have to share the spotlight with another star addition to this Seawolves squad, as the coaching staff brought in Taylor Ranftle from Virginia. The junior from Hauppauge did not have eye-popping numbers on a stacked Cavaliers team, but she was ranked No. 14 in the country by ESPNHS coming out of high school.

With the ambitions that Stony Brook has, it will need all the talent they could get.

““I think we’ve got to take the next step,” Spallina said. For a team that has proven they can compete by winning a game in each of the last two NCAA Tournaments, it is not just about getting there anymore. “I think we’ve got to go and win some big games.”

One of the biggest obstacles in doing just that will be overcoming the toughest loss in the history of the program. Frankie Caridi did it all as Stony Brook’s goalkeeper. From leading the team to being a Tewaraaton Nominee last season, it is hard to lose your best player.

““I think the big thing is not expecting your goalie to be Frankie,” Spallina said. He will be giving sophomore Kaitlyn Leahy a tremendous responsibility in trying to come close to replacing the former third-team All American. “Listen, if the best goalie in the world was in our goal this year, we would have questions because Frankie’s been my goalie for four years, and I don’t know another way.”

What Spallina does know is that his program is no longer an unknown. When he took the reins, that is almost exactly what it was. Now, with two straight America East titles in their back pockets, the Seawolves are looking for more.

“I think this is a team that could compete with anybody. I think if our goaltending play will be good, this team will be great.”

Great for Spallina is not the second round of the NCAA Tournament. It is much, much more. Only time will tell how far they can go, but the Seawolves open up against a tough USC squad on Feb. 20.]]></content:encoded>

She urged students to take part in uncomfortable conversations in order to expand their knowledge. MEGAN MILLER / THE STATESMAN[/caption]

Soledad O’Brien stopped by Stony Brook University on Monday, Feb. 16 as part of her Black in America Tour of 2015, which she began last month.

Former NBA player Etan Thomas, author and journalist Joan Morgan, activist Luis Paulino and O’Brien, a Suffolk County native who grew up in St. James, made up the panel.

Born to a black, Cuban mother and a white, Australian father, who was a founding professor at Stony Brook, O’Brien observed firsthand the difficulties that families like her own would face—for example, being turned away from buying a home.

She also struggled with people questioning her race as she grew up. She often had uncomfortable experiences; she recalls when a photographer asked her if she was black at age 11.

Her Black in America project began back in 2008 as a six-hour documentary. The first two hours covered the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., and the remainder questioned where society stands in terms of civil rights.

The tagline of the campaign is “I am the conversation,” and O’Brien urged college students to take part in uncomfortable conversations in order to expand their knowledge, saying, “I think the most important thing that any college student can do is to open up your mind."

O’Brien said she hopes to open up an exchange rather than a lecture on issues surrounding race, therefore giving college students a new perspective from their peers.

“[If] you haven’t gone out of your way to be involved in uncomfortable conversations and you don’t have a group of friends for whom you feel like sometimes you’re competing with them in difficult ways, you’re probably not having a really challenging college experience,” O’Brien said.

Morgan said she believes that there is great potential for the current generation to bring about change, referencing the Millions March, a black youth organized protest that drew tens of thousands of people.

These youth leaders did not choose to be in the forefront, but rather used the magnitude of people who showed up in to showcase the immense issue of “Black Lives Matter.”

“Of course all lives matter, but that’s not what we’re talking about,” Thomas said, in response to those who say that all lives matter.

In 2012, Paulino was defending a black adolescent who had been approached by police for riding his bicycle on the sidewalk. As a result, Paulino found himself surrounded by five police officers.

After arguing with the officers, Paulino was charged with resisting arrest. A taxi driver watching the incident take place caught the violence on camera.

Paulino was grabbed from his wrists by the police officer, leaving the former college football player unable to complete a single pushup.

“We’re often stigmatized before we’re given a chance to be humanized,” Paulino said.

Paulino urged black youth to understand that when they walk across the graduation stage with their “letters,” whether it is their fraternity letters or just their diploma, a person looking at them from a criminal perspective will not know of their accomplishments.

“We need to coexist and it needs to matter to all of us equally,” Roger Carson, a senior mechanical engineering major and a member of the Student African-American Brotherhood, said.

“This is something that we’re not going to get over until we actually do something about it,” Diana Costa, a junior health sciences major of Omega Phi Beta Sorority, said. “It’s all of us together, because at the end of the day, it’s our humanity at risk.”]]></content:encoded>

When you talk to Stony Brook women’s lacrosse’s senior star midfielder Michelle Rubino about all of the success that she has enjoyed in her college career, she does not have much to say.

She would likely would agree with New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who once said, “I'm not a person who defends myself very often. I kind of let my actions speak for me.”

Rubino does not need to prove anything to anybody, as her career on Long Island has taken care of that.

For a player who has not only her coach but also former teammates raving about every aspect of her game, she has no need or reason to talk. In fact, not doing so can help her teammates as well.

“The best way to lead is by example, and Michelle goes above and beyond on the field and in the weight room to do that,” former Stony Brook lacrosse star Claire Petersen said. “She has such an impact on the team just by her presence and attitude on the field.“

If that makes her special, than her play on the lacrosse field makes her career as a Seawolf one of the most impressive ones yet.

Rubino is a two-way midfielder, showing up everywhere on the field. As the opposing team mounts an attack, you can find her racing back to try to force a turnover. Look the other way, and Rubino is already near the offensive third seeking a teammate in order to facilitate a safe clear and eventual goal.

“She’s unbelievable,” Head Coach Joe Spallina said. “I think she’s somebody that people won’t truly appreciate until she’s graduated because then they’ll realize how lucky we are.”

Before Rubino does graduate and head off onto her next career, she will look to add onto what has been an impressive 60 games in her three seasons as a Seawolf thus far.

The Long Islander has scored 102 goals and tallied 45 assists thus far in her career, meaning that in each game she has played, she has, on average, been in some way been responsible for more than two of the team’s goals.

Each number is impressive in and of itself, but the fact that last season she was third in goals and second in assists shows that there is really nothing that Rubino cannot do.

“What makes Michelle the lacrosse player she is, is her incredible athleticism and field vision,” Petersen said about Rubino having the complete package. She added how it is, “[that] combined with her drive to not only win but to win without it being a question.”

The most impressive of it all is that her glimmering contributions come in the nitty-gritty areas of the game, such as ground balls and passing.

“Her stats don’t always necessarily show on either end,” Spallina said about one of his seniors this season. “But, without her, you’d be in big trouble.”

Quite simply, there is nowhere that Rubino is not. She finished last season with a team-leading 30 caused turnovers, forcing errors from her opponents.

Then, she managed to find herself in the right place at the right time too, tallying the second most ground balls on the squad with 43. Some may say that is luck, but it takes an immense knowledge of the sport to know to follow the ball and where it is going to end up.

So, why does Rubino, one of the most talented players on the team, spend a lot of her time doing what some may call the “little things,” however big they actually are?

“I’m not really all about goals,” Rubino said. “I’m more of a transitional player.”

That in itself says a lot about her character, as many grow up dreaming of scoring the highlight-reel goals and being all over the recaps rather than doing whatever it takes to help the team win.

Yet, while freshmen Courtney Murphy and Dorrien Van Dyke led the team in goals and the country within their class, it was Rubino who would manage to shine in the biggest of moments. It was her who got the team off to a good start with the opening goal on the Seawolves' way to beating Towson in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. She was not at the very top, but she certainly scored goals, too.

That, and she helped mentor her young teammates as well.

“I believe Michelle deserves nearly all of the credit with helping the younger girls because I am sure the new girls have a whole new definition of hard work after seeing what Michelle does,” Petersen said.

That includes the example she provides for the rest of the team when the moment is not hers and she has to sub out.

“When Michelle rarely and briefly does sub out of the game, I have my eye in the box until she returns,” Petersen said. “That is both when I was playing and now when I watch from the stands.”

Petersen was Stony Brook’s first All-American and set the NCAA record for career assists for game, yet she was learning day in and day out from one of the younger players on her team.

Whether she realizes it or not, Rubino has had an impact on Stony Brook lacrosse.

“I guess it’s just me,” Rubino said about her strong work ethic. “I like to strive for the best and never settle for anything less.”]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Cukrov looks to continue domination of America East</title>

The Stony Brook softball team has high hopes for 2015.

After reaching the America East finals in 2014, the annual preseason coaches’ poll named the Seawolves favorites to win in conference this season. These expectations are quite dependent on the performance of reigning America East Pitcher of the Year Allison Cukrov, who has already established herself as one of the greatest pitchers to ever play for Stony Brook.

Cukrov currently sits in the top five of every major career pitching statistic in Stony Brook history, including records for shutouts and saves. Last season, she finished 23-9 with a 2.10 ERA en route to her second America East Pitcher of the Year award.

While these accolades are quite impressive, Cukrov insists that the only numbers in which she is concerned are wins and losses.

“To me stats don’t really matter. I would rather finish with a [conference championship],” Cukrov said. “Obviously you want to perform at your best, but I want to win for my teammates and walk out in the end with a championship,”

Cukrov began playing softball at a young age in her native California. Once she developed into a standout high school pitcher, she wanted to go to an East Coast school to continue pitching and pursue an education. After Stony Brook recruited her, she felt that she had found an ideal school.

“I knew I wanted to go away for college. I knew I wanted to leave California and go east to an academic school where I could still play a high level of softball,” Cukrov said.

Once at Stony Brook, feelings of homesickness became an issue during her freshman year. With her home over 3,000 miles away, she sought the help of her fellow Seawolves in adjusting to the campus life.

“Being on a team has really helped with the transition of coming from the West Coast,” Cukrov said. “When you have that foundation of people who want to see you do well, that helps.”

Once her freshman softball season came around, Cukrov immediately dominated the America East. She won Conference Pitcher of the Year as a true freshman, setting single-season school records with 25 wins, 13 shutouts and 30 complete games along the way. From that point on, there was no question as to if she could succeed on the East Coast. Cukrov had found her niche.

“It really boils down to the support I’ve had from my coaches and teammates,” Cukrov said. “Knowing they have my back has helped me learn and grow as a pitcher.”

With three successful seasons already under her belt, Cukrov now uses her veteran status to assist underclassmen adjusting to the college game. It is with this experience, she says, that she is able to contribute to the team in unquantifiable ways.

“Now that I’m a senior I kind of see myself in more of a leadership role,” Cukrov said. “I am trying to mentor the younger pitchers.”

During Cukrov’s time at Stony Brook, the Seawolves have become an America East powerhouse. The team has gone deep into the conference tournament every year since 2012, including a tournament championship in 2013. With the team coming into this season as America East favorites, Cukrov and the Seawolves have an opportunity to build upon the program’s recent success.

“It feels like we have a target on our back,” Cukrov said of being ranked first in the coaches’ poll. “But it’s a good thing to have. It has motivated us to do well and now it is clear that everyone else has high expectations of us too.”

While 2015 has the potential to be a historic season for the Seawolves, Cukrov will have the opportunity to make some history of her own: she is 14 wins away from becoming the winningest pitcher in program history.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Stony Brook men&#039;s lacrosse hopes experience and hard work will pay off</title>

The Stony Brook men’s lacrosse team had its 2014 season stolen from it with only a few seconds separating the Seawolves from an appearance in the America East Championship game.

Lyle Thompson of Albany, the Co-Tewaraaton Trophy winner from last season, made what, for lack of better words, was an unbelievable play. He forced the Seawolves-Great Danes semifinal matchup into overtime, where Albany would end any hopes that Head Coach Jim Nagle’s team had of an NCAA berth.

It was the best game that Stony Brook played all year long, at the time that they had to do it. Yet, it was still not enough.

“I think we are a much more resolved team to kind of give that effort that we gave in the last game of the season,” Nagle said in looking ahead to a new year of lacrosse. This time, however, he said it will be, “every game of the season this year, and at every practice.”

All the effort the Seawolves can give, all the time.

That starts with the student-athletes themselves.

For the past couple of years, Stony Brook has been extremely young, with then-freshmen and then-sophomores carrying the load. Those guys are still somewhat young, but more experienced and ready to do whatever it takes to win.

“ We’re doing a lot of different things in Dubin, our gym, and it drives us to be more of a unit and to be more compatible I guess with each other,” junior Challen Rogers said about the strength and conditioning work the team has done during the offseason at the Dubin Family Athletic Performance Center. “We did a program last year that brought us together a lot, and like I said before, we have a lot of returners, so we just try to lead and everyone kind of follows.”

The Seawolves will need to continue to grow as one in order to make their mark in the America East Conference and in what they hope is the country.

“We feel a lot older than we’ve been,” Nagle said. “I think anytime when you’re a coach, you want to develop players and develop teams, so the fact that we have guys back really enables us to develop and grow individually, but also as a team.”

One of the positions at which Stony Brook will have to come together as a team the most is at the face-off spot, where a midfielder takes the draw. One of the squad’s biggest strengths last year lay in the talent of Kyle Rowe, who dominated face-offs for the team before transferring to Duke to join his brother.

“We have Jay Lindsay, who was a little injured last year, and Frank Lucatuorto, who took a lot of face-offs freshman year and did a real good job against some of the best guys in the country,” Nagle said, pointing out that there was plenty of depth to make up for what may seem like a big loss.

“They changed the rules on the faceoff to make it more of a ground ball so I’m not concerned about it,” Nagle said. “I think we’ll be solid there."

A position that was up in the air last season was in goal, as multiple keepers got their shot at earning the starting role. One rose above to seize the spot, and that was Hayden Johnstone, a freshman at the time.

Not the typical goalie, often sprinting down field in order to help the Seawolves clear the ball, Johnstone still managed to earn a spot on the America East All-Rookie team.

The thing is, according to Nagle, he is getting even better. Not a bad thing for the Seawolves, but certainly not good for the rest of the conference.

“Hayden did a tremendous job this offseason conditioning [himself],” the head coach said. “He was one of the hardest working guys in the Dubin Center, so that was a real positive sign.”

Another positive sign for Stony Brook is that Johnstone is not alone. He will need to play the way he has and work just as hard in order to reassure everyone that he deserves his position.

“Brandon Maciejewski is a freshman,” Nagle said of yet another student-athlete coming aboard who can contribute, “as well as Pat Fleming, who is like the heart and soul of our team.”

If one thing is certain, it is that the team has no desire to settle for another disappointing finish in the conference tournament. This team wants to win.

“Whenever you lose like we’ve lost to Albany the last two years,” Rogers reminisced on the way the Seawolves went out in their last two postseason runs, before saying, “We’re trying to get better and compete to [reach] the final of the America East.”

The Seawolves will face tests early and often, which will give them an opportunity to prepare themselves for what they hope is a longer run in the playoffs.

After Maryland came to Long Island last year with the No.1 ranking in hand, there is a chance that Duke will do the same. Rowe returns to give his old teammates a stern test on Feb. 22, in what will be one of the most attended lacrosse games in Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium history.

It is there that one of the best teams in the nation will see a somewhat new look from the Seawolves. Rogers and senior Mike Rooney will switch positions this season, something they have experimented with in the past.

“Well, I mean last year we switched a few times during the season,” Rooney said. “It’s the same thing with our offense, just share the ball.”

Rogers usually plays from up top in the midfield, but will drop down to Rooney’s typical spot to do just that, looking to feed the likes of Eastwood and Schultz as an attackman. Meanwhile, Rooney moves to midfield.

It proved a good idea in the first game of the season against Manhattan, as the duo combined for seven goals and three assists in a 19-3 blowout win inside a snow-filled Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium.

Rogers’ eye for the field and ability to find openings in the defense earned himself recognition as a preseason All-American Honorable Mention.

“I think, obviously we proved it in that one game that we could give a real solid effort and compete among the best teams in the country,” Nagle said about last year’s tough loss against eventual NCAA quarterfinalist Albany. “So, we’re trying to do that in practice every day and every game we play this year.”]]></content:encoded>

It seemed like a movie we have all seen before. Albany was leading by eleven points in the first half and had buried five three-pointers prior to the five minute mark of the first half. Stony Brook was starved for offense, unable to crack the code of its opponent’s 2-3 zone.

Trailing 29-18 with 3:55 remaining in the first half, kenpom.com simulations estimated that Stony Brook’s probability of winning the game Tuesday night was just 8.3 percent.

Late in the first half, Stony Brook Head Coach Steve Pikiell substituted Scott King, perhaps the unlikeliest of heroes, into the game for the Seawolves.

King reigned the floor for the last four minutes of the half, providing the spark that the offense so desperately needed. The junior stretch forward scored eight points to carry the Seawolves on a 11-2 run to cut the Great Danes lead to just 31-29 entering the intermission, much more manageable than the daunting deficit they faced just moments prior.

In the second half, the Seawolves’ energy was too much for the Great Danes to handle. As a team, the Seawolves snagged nine offensive rebounds and forced seven turnovers in the half. Carson Puriefoy was a blur in transition and King threw down a scintillating alley-oop to cap off his best performance of the season.

Stony Brook went on a 14-4 run to give the Seawolves a 55-49 lead with 3:51 left. The Seawolves held on for a much needed morale-boosting victory, winning the matchup by the score of 59-56.

Evan Singletary had a chance to tie the game for the Great Danes in the final seconds when he took a shot from 25-feet out, but Puriefoy was there with a hand in his face, forcing a miss and giving Albany its first loss the America East conference season.

Albany had entered the game on a 13-game winning streak and was one of only five teams in the nation undefeated in conference play. The Seawolves’ win avenged home losses to Albany suffered earlier this season and in last year’s America East playoffs.

Jameel Warney had another stellar performance. The junior center had 20 points and 11 rebounds in the game, securing his NCAA-leading 18th double-double of the year.

Warney also played a crucial role on the defensive end of the floor. He had five blocks in the game, helping the Seawolves hold Albany to just 34.5 percent shooting from the field.

Puriefoy added 15 points and four assists for the Seawolves. Puriefoy pushed the tempo several times in the second half, scoring fast-break lay-ups with both hands, a vital reason why Stony Brook was able to come back.

Rayshaun McGrew was the game’s leader in rebounds, grabbing 14 on the night.

Although Warney, Puriefoy and McGrew all had a say in the victory, Tuesday will be remembered by many as the “The Scott King Game.”

King had not played even ten minutes in a game since Nov. 21 against Hofstra. Most of the little time he had played since then had been in garbage time. But when Pikiell called upon King to play 17 minutes on the road against the defending conference champions and Stony Brook’s arch-rival, King did not miss his chance to leave a mark.

King’s 12 points and four rebounds were the difference in a highly-contested game against one of the hottest teams in the country. Without his clutch shooting off the bench, the Seawolves would not have been able to capture their biggest America East win of the year.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_35661" align="alignleft" width="300"]<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(rapper)#mediaviewer/File:Drake_Bluesfest.jpg"><img class="wp-image-35661 size-half-width" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Drake_Bluesfest-300x244.jpg" alt="PHOTO CREDIT : BRENNAN SCHNELL" width="300" height="244" /></a> According to billboard.com, Drake's surprise album, "If You're Reading This It's Too Late," sold 495k copies in it's first week. His album was released Valentine's Day weekend. PHOTO CREDIT : BRENNAN SCHNELL[/caption]

After the release of his critically acclaimed album, "Nothing Was The Same," the hype for another release by Drake was at an all-time high. When NBA star DeMar DeRozan, who plays for Drake’s hometown Toronto Raptors, hinted that the artist had a mixtape on the way, the hype grew even higher. That hype saw the release of "If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late" without any promotion on Valentine’s Day.

While the hype was huge, Drake could not deliver. His lyrics just were not there.

In songs like the opener “Legend,” as well as "No Tellin','" it seems as though Drake is just boasting. There is no purpose to it, it is just filler. Tracks like "Energy" lacked any oomph and felt slow.

In general, the emotional content was lacking. You are not going to call your ex after listening to this. That being said, Drake appeared to be angry at times, something that was rarely seen earlier on his career. From throwing shots at music mogul Diddy to outright insulting former Young Money label mate Tyga on “6PM In New York,” this is a new side to Drake that many are beginning to like. Also, his lyrics on "6 God" as well as "You &amp; The 6" were worthy to be on his upcoming fourth album, "Views From the 6."

Nearly half of the mixtape was produced by longtime Drake collaborator, Boi-1da. In the tracks he was on, Boi-1da's signature snare fell upon welcomed ears. His beat essentially made "10 Bands" a certified banger as well as making "6 God" one of the best tracks of 2015. Boi-1da, while handling the majority of the production, was not the only producer on the mixtape. Noah "40" Shebib, the producer for many of Drake's most popular songs, appears four times on the mixtape, with production on "Madonna," "Jungle," "You &amp; The 6," and "6 Man."

Drake also brought in newcomer Wondagirl, known for her work on Jay Z's last album Magna Carta Holy Grail, and Grand Hustle producer and G.O.O.D. Music rapper, Travi$ Scott. Wondagurl's work on "Used To" was excellent and was the definite production highlight. Scott's dark and heavy production was evident on his vocal feature in "Company." Even October's Very Own's residential crooner, PartyNextDoor, had two production credits, including opener "Legend."

In his 2014 track “0 to 100,” Drake warned us “we already got spring 2015 poppin’.” Unfortunately, "If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late" did not get it “poppin’.” The mixtape had some definite lows, especially in the lyrical department. It also was not as emotional as past Drake releases either. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as Drake’s new angry side is pretty impressive.

The album’s high was the production. Bringing out younger producers like Wondagurl, as well as past frequent collaborators like Shebib and Boi-1da, was great for production diversity. Also, bringing in OVO members such as PartyNextDoor on the production team was great promotion for his brand. Must listens include "6 God," "6 PM in New York," and "10 Bands."

All in all, "If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late" is worth a listen, maybe even two, but to buy it for $12.99 on iTunes? That is a stretch.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Stony Brook community comes together for Chapel Hill shooting vigil</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>By Christopher Leelum</strong>

The three smiling faces projected on a screen who looked out among the hundreds of Stony Brook students during the vigil on Tuesday for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill shooting did not belong to just the victims of a heinous crime.

The vigil, held in the SAC auditorium, was a response to last week's killing of Deah Barakat, his wife Yusor Abu-Salha and her younger sister, Razan Abu-Salha, who was just 19. Forty-six-year-old suspect Craig Stephen Hicks has been charged with murder, and questions still remain as to the motive.

Sister Sanaa Nadim, chaplain for the Stony Brook Muslim Students Association and organizer of the event, said they are more than casualties, but symbols.

“We are all Deah, Yusor and Razan,” Nadim said. “We are all the 21 Egyptian men killed some days ago. We are the French who mourned, those in Copenhagen, and the Jordanian pilot who burned to death.”

Though there were mentions of hate crimes and religious intolerance, the main message was community. The focus took a broad, unified, and somber tone.

“And we are standing, together, for all the good that we can find in each other,” Nadim said as her voice wavered.

Stony Brook’s large Muslim contingent came in support, but both the audience and the guest speakers had hints of black, white, and Asian, Christian and Jewish, and more.

“We must look beyond yarmulke,” Rabbi Joseph Topek, chaplain and director of the Hillel Foundation for Jewish Life, said. “We must look beyond the hijab, beyond the long skirt, or the turban, or the beard and know the individual.”

Assistant Dean of Students Ellen Driscoll cited the Stony Brook University Community Pledge to reinforce the sense of diversity and unity of the student body.

“Ours is a community that promotes equality, civility, caring, responsibility, accountability, and respect,” Driscoll said.

While incidents like these may evoke fear in other Muslim students across the nation, freshman biology major Shinchita Hassan said she has no real fear for her life.

“I’m not really that scared,” Hassan said. “I’ve lived in New York my whole life and have never been personally persecuted.”

Her friend Emily Gaines, also a freshman biology major, was a bit more morose.

“It’s sad there’s still so much hate in the world,” Gaines said.

But Chief of Police and Assistant Vice President for Campus Safety Robert Lenahan was there to quell any trepidation.

“While we are an extremely safe campus, we want to respond and we want to be there and address any concerns students may have,” Lenahan said. He also mentioned a “zero-tolerance policy” for hate crimes of any crimes on campus.

Yoseph Saleh, a close friend to victim Barakat, was supposed to be a special guest speaker, but traffic held up his appearance. Stony Brook’s Muslim Student Association’s President Mudassir Syed read his statement in his place.

Saleh’s message began with an anecdote about the “tall, immature, pale kid” he first met while playing basketball at the university.

After a game, Saleh said, “I was seriously confused about how genuine and nice he was to me compared to how he was acting on the court. At one point I thought something was wrong with him because of how nice he was.”

At the end of his message, the audience grew silent when Saleh wrote about not being able to attend Deah and Yusor’s wedding this past December and wishing he’d see them around spring break time.

“Now I can’t see him ever again, and I didn’t even have a chance to give him his wedding gift,” Saleh wrote.

At the end of the vigil, Nadim took the stage again for a special request.

With Terry Jacks’ “Seasons in the Sun” played out to accompany the multitude of tiny lights in the auditorium, Nadim asked everyone stand with a candle or a cellphone light.

“We are lighting the flame of hope tonight,” she said.

People have an amazing ability to ignore the basic lessons we learned as little kids. I can not count how many times I have seen a fully-grown adult struggle with the idea that “Life isn’t fair” or that “You can’t always get what you want.” Yet many people still choose to ignore these basic fundamental pillars of our society, and they have good reason to do such a thing. These life lessons can hurt, and we often do not like to think about them a lot.

As much as I thought I was above all of that, I got a cruel reminder of a rough one: “All good things must come to an end.”

Longtime host of "The Daily Show" Jon Stewart announced his imminent retirement and man, did it hurt. Right off the heels of Stephen Colbert’s exit from his own show, this was the second strike in a deadly one-two punch to both political satire and my late-night television routine.

I could talk for hours and hours about how much Stewart meant to me personally for days on end. "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart" has been broadcasting since I was four years old, and over the years it grew to mean a lot. When I was in middle school, I dreamed of one day being a satirist just like Stewart was because, well, I was a really weird kid. "The Daily Show" was one of those comforting constants in my life, always being there when I needed it and a surefire bet for at least a half hour of happiness.

However, losing Stewart means a lot more to the nation than it does to me, especially for the media. Since he first came on air in 1999, the world of politics and the media surrounding it has grown more and more ridiculous. Stewart serves as a vital purpose in this world order. He is not just a voice of reason, but more accurately, a voice against insanity.

Stewart is an anchor of logic and reason in a world where both 24-hour news coverage and politicians are quickly losing their grip on reality and constantly embellishing the truth. He is vicious, armed with a sharp wit and a crack team of news clip editors that knew how to get their point across.

Stewart has a voice that needs to be present. Throughout his career, politicians and anchors had to tread more carefully, knowing he was ready to tear apart any illogical things that they would say. Seeing him lampoon every time Fox News lost its mind or George Bush forgot how grammar works sent a clear message to the political world: they would not be able to speak without thinking what they were going to say first.

Stewart is an icon and he will be hard to replace. I am not sure if they will be able to, especially seeing how poorly Larry Wilmore is doing in replacing Colbert, but at the same time we need to replace him. The world needs a voice like his, one that can keep parties in line and serve as a guiding voice for the American public and leaders.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_35688" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-35688 size-medium" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/msavigil_31-600x400.jpg" alt="HEATHER KHALIFA / THE STATESMAN " width="600" height="400" /> The Stony Brook Muslim Student Association hosted a vigil on Tuesday, Feb. 17 to remember the three students that were shot in Chapel Hill, N.C. last week. <em>HEATHER KHALIFA / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

Last Tuesday, the news of the deaths of Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23; his wife, Yusor Abu-Salha, 21; and her sister, Razan Abu-Salha, 19 shocked their North Carolina community. Almost instantly, the event created a ripple effect of grief and pain across the globe.

People all over the world shared the news over Twitter and created hashtags to bring the news front and center, propelling the media to slowly follow suit. Yet, I felt that a hashtag or a tweet by itself would not be enough to share my grief for these innocent souls.

Without even knowing Deah, Yusor and Razan personally, I found myself aching to pay my respects.

With fate being on my side, the Muslim Student Association (MSA) decided to host a vigil to commemorate these students on a day and at a time that I would be able to attend.

If you think about it, going to a stranger’s vigil seems strange. However, I found myself nodding in agreement when one of the speakers read poetry that described these deaths as though our own siblings were slain.

I walked into the vigil knowing so much about Deah, Yusor and Razan. I read their tweets, watched their Vines and scrolled through their Tumblrs. I saw their photos over and over and read about their charity work and thought to myself, “I can’t decide what’s bigger—their smiles or their hearts.”

Through bittersweet social media, I was able to see these three great people as my own siblings. Siblings I would be proud of. The vigil echoed what I saw on social media and much more.

I learned that Deah and Yusor just got married a month ago. I learned about how he was a Stephen Curry fan and how he was raising money for dental care for refugee victims of the Syrian crisis. I learned that Yusor declared America as her home and was proud of it. I learned about how Razan was “kinda dorky” and was studying architecture and environmental design at North Carolina State University.

The vigil reminded me of all these facts and how lucky any one of us would have been to be in their presence. The presider, Sister Sanaa, reminded the attendees of how we were not only Deah, Yusor and Razan, but that we were also the Egyptian Coptic Christians that were murdered, the children of Peshawar, Pakistan who were robbed of their lives and so many other victims of inhumane acts around the world.

And I was not alone in feeling the pain of loss for these three students, or the loss of the people who have been killed around the world. The SAC auditorium had quietly filled up, each attendee standing, expressing and experiencing the event.

There were so many people. There were MSA members, fraternity brothers, professors, parents, young children and others. Students and faculty from all different backgrounds went out of their way on a Tuesday night to pay their respects and condemn the violence.

The tears I held back through the program did not blind me from noticing the diversity of the audience in the room.

My friends who came with me to attend the event were not Muslim and did not know these victims.

They just came to pay their respects.

To see them along with so many others mourn these deaths made my heart swell with so many emotions and reminded me that the Stony Brook University community is something to be proud of.

When I left the auditorium and walked back to my car, some of the closing song’s lyrics remained in my head:

“We had joy, we had fun,

We had seasons in the sun,

But the hills that we climbed were just seasons

Out of time.”

Rest in peace Deah, Yusor and Razan. Rest in peace my siblings.

		<title>College Gal Cooking: Nutella s&#039;mores pizza</title>

Nestled in the hilly province of Cuneo, Italy is the town of Alba, where the confectionary group Ferrero is based and Nutella was born. During World War II, there was a cocoa shortage in the town, as was the case across Europe. Pietro Ferrero, founder of the Ferrero Company, decided to capitalize on the abundance of hazelnuts in the region and mix it together with the limited supply of cocoa, and thus Nutella was born. However, his son, Michele Ferrero—the world’s wealthiest chocolatier before his death last Saturday, is credited for crafting Nutella into the spread we all know and love today. Ferrero also created Ferrero Rocher as well as Kinder Surprise Eggs and Tic-Tac mints, making him “the richest candy man on the planet,” according to Forbes magazine.

So it seems only fitting that the man who was often referred to as the “real-life Willy Wonka” passed away on Valentine’s Day, a holiday defined by chocolate and love. He was 89.

To honor Ferrero and his legacy, our College Gal Cooking recipe this week is for Nutella S’mores Pizza, accentuating what makes Nutella special: it goes with everything.

&nbsp;

<strong>Ingredients:</strong>

2 cups of Nutella spread (but by all means, spread more or less)
1 packet of active dry yeast
2 ½ cups of all-purpose Flour
1 cup of crushed graham crackers
¼ cup granulated sugar
½ teaspoon of salt
2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
3 cups mini marshmallows

&nbsp;

The trickiest part of this otherwise simple dessert is making the crust. First, mix a cup of warm water with the active dry yeast. Add the flour, crushed graham crackers, sugar, salt and olive oil. Blend with a mixer, and then roll into a ball and place on a floured countertop, where the dough will be rolled out. Then, transfer the dough to anywhere between a 12-inch circle pizza dish to one that is 16 inches—I would recommend a 15 inch dish to avoid a thick crust that masks the taste of the Nutella. Bake in a 350-degree oven for 15-20 minutes.

Once the dough is baked, spread the Nutella uniformly over the entire pizza, then coat with mini marshmallows. Put back in oven for another 15-20 minutes.

Then, drizzle the pizza with chocolate sauce of any brand for taste and decorative purposes. Whipped cream and strawberries can also be added, if desired. Slice into eight pieces, and enjoy!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_36016" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-36016" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-22-at-7.32.25-PM-600x398.png" alt="PHOTO CREDIT: MEGAN MILLER" width="600" height="398" /> Soledad O'Brien, far left, was joined by a fellow journalist, an activist and a former NBA athlete during her Feb. 16 panel at Stony Brook University.

On a college campus as vast and diverse as Stony Brook’s, it is no wonder that we are constantly engulfed in waves of endless chatter. Whether it be in the middle of North Reading Room or dining among fellow Seawolves at the SAC, conversation is the backbone of each and every one of our days.

And yet, in her stirring visit to Stony Brook University this past Monday, award winning journalist Soledad O’Brien brought the content of our conversation to the forefront of discussion at the Staller Center as part of her Black in America Tour. In a press conference prior to the start of her show, O’Brien reminded student journalists that their goal as college students should be to open up their minds and engage in conversations that make them feel uncomfortable.

The notion of conversation seemed to be the theme of the night. The tagline of the newest segment, entitled “Black and Blue,” called to attention police brutality in minority communities and was stated as “I Am The Conversation.”

As the discourse progressed throughout the evening between O’Brien and a group of three other panelists, which included former NBA star Etan Thomas, activist in the Black Lives Matter movement, Luis Paulino and journalist Joan Morgan, revelations about the plight of African Americans began to surface, as did numerous other questions about the matter. This is where I realized that although O’Brien’s “conversation” mostly focused on African American issues, there are other conversations that society as a whole needs to be having about every type of person.

Obviously, the key players in issues facing blacks and Latinos in minority communities are blacks and Latinos. However, one of the questions raised in my mind was where exactly my position in the discussion was. I do not feel that I am alone in the intermediate phase between “the conversation” and “the other.” I often view myself as being isolated from discussions about minority issues. Despite feeling heartfelt sympathy for the families of Eric Garner or Trayvon Martin, two innocent African Americans who lost their lives to senseless violence, the depth of my sadness and the breadth of a heavy heart can never communicate to the African American community that I understand.

I understand not necessarily because I have lost a loved one to racially-fueled violence or even because our skin color is the same. I understand because I am a human being. And on that level, I do understand the struggle of fitting in, of feeling compassion for a slain soul, of grappling with loneliness and discouragement and misunderstanding. I understand being judged before being given the chance to prove myself. I understand the feeling of resentment towards those who cannot empathize with my plight.

I understand because I am human. We all are. And at the basis of all of our struggles are the core moral values and principles that do not make us very different at all.

Through conversation, my understanding can be made evident.  Though I am not African American, I can sympathize. I do have something to offer, whether it be support or an ear to lend to the Lives Matter movement.

Former NBA player Etan Thomas mentioned in his speech that parents constantly have to engage in discussions or “the talk” with their children about how to behave if a police officer were to approach them. They must never move suddenly. They should always converse with the officer courteously. They should make all intentions plain and clear when reaching into a back pocket, slowly and clearly state, “I am now reaching for my ID.” Then reach for it slowly.

The sad reality of this was conveyed with gravity, but also a sense of masked vexation against law enforcement for being part of what many African Americans see as institutional racism.

Although it is undeniable that police brutality against minorities does exist, it is a fact that is being hammered into the fabric of African American youth, with fewer acknowledgements given to the fact that the majority of law enforcement is there to protect everyone.

Instead of fueling hatred towards law enforcement, both sides, the black and the blue, need to understand one another’s sentiments in order to begin fostering better relations.

But just as officers need to be aware of the uncomfortable conversation that African American parents need to have with youths, African American parents and youths need to be mindful that the parents of trainees of the NYPD also have to have uncomfortable conversations with their children as well.

Established NYPD officers also need to keep their young officers aware of the stigma rising against themselves and remind them constantly to be even more diligent and cautious when dealing with minority suspects. The point of the plight is not to debate who has it worse, but to accept that everyone is fighting against stigmas and strifes.

These are only a few of the conversations that fall under the umbrella of the Lives Matter movement. It is a conversation that every single member of society needs to be a part of, and it needs to be one that is approached with willingness and, above all, understanding.

We may not always agree, but it is important to be engaged no matter how uncomfortable or ugly the reality of these murky issues may seem. We are obligated as a community as diverse as our own to forge forward in order to break barriers against racial oppression through discourse and through listening.]]></content:encoded>

Lights, camera, action. Stony Brook introduced the SUNY system's first ever Master of Fine Arts program to its Southampton and Manhattan campuses.

This three-year program has attracted aspiring filmmakers from across the country. The program delves into the field of film making, with real world experience tied into every class.

The 45-48 credit program is lead by independent film producer and co-founder of Killer Films, Christine Vachon. Vachon has worked in various film schools and has noticed the disconnection of the academic world to the reality of film production.

This program is looking to change that and hopes to compete with the prestigious film schools while remaining affordable.

This creative staff consists of highly accredited producers, directors, screenwriters and novelists.  Emmy award-winning screenwriter and former writer's agent Annette Handley Chandler is on the staff, as well as writer/director Jennie Allen, Lenny Crooks, who ran the UK Film fund, producer Simone Pero and Killer co-founder Pamela Koffler, to name a few.

With such a close association to Killer Films, students from the program have worked on some of the company's most accredited pieces, such as the Oscar nominated film “Still Alice.”

A class called “Masters in Independent Production” used the production of “Still Alice” as a main reference to the creation and processes of filmmaking.

Students worked behind the scenes of the highly buzzed about film, assisting directors and producers, taking photographs and conducting Alzheimer’s research.

The film was in the works when the class was in session on and had the directors visiting the class. The students saw the script, the schedule, early cuts, the funding and the entire development of “Still Alice.”

Not only did the students learn from observation, three students physically worked on the film that has earned actress Julianne Moore a Golden Globe Award for best actress, a Critics' Choice Movie Award a SAG Award and a BAFTA Award with a nomination for an Academy Award.

“Nasty Baby,” starring Kristen Wiig and Alia Shawkat, is another film we will be hearing about that was produced with the help of this program. It won the Berlin Teddy award and was screened in the Sundance Film Festival. Students shot and edited short parts of the film.

The close association with Killer Films gives students the opportunity to work closely with the company.

However, the programs initial goal is to give these students the right tools to venture out on their own creative paths.

Producer, novelist and associate director of the MFA program Magdalene Brandeis said, “The students learn what actual production problems are. It is about current practice and protocols in the film world and how that leads to lessons in the classroom. We see a career as a whole. You realize there is a long haul to crafting a career path.”

After three years, the students have a myriad of skills in their tool belts. The program is working on a curriculum that will prepare students for screenwriting, directing and producing.

Associate Provost of the Southampton Graduate Arts program Robert Reeves expressed the goal of the program, saying “Get it made, make it right and get it seen. [This is] a curriculum driven by making films and having hands on experience.”

The students will have the experience of directing episodic series, producing creative screen writes, scripts and directing short films of increasing complexity and depth. They will then leave with a significant project of their own.

The program is expected to expand in the near future and bring undergraduate classes pertaining to producing, directing and screenwriting to Stony Brook’s main campus. It will possibly create an undergraduate Fine Arts minor based on film as well.

Being only a month or so old, this program consists of approximately 30 graduate students of all ages, backgrounds and walks of life.

It is the only SUNY film school so far that has been approved by the New York State Department of Education.

The program's growing reputation and affordability resulted in a flood of applications. The program hopes to shape the future of film, and place Stony Brook student work in the spotlight.]]></content:encoded>

CHRISTOPHER CAMERON / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Alan Alda, the actor, director, screenwriter and author who helped establish the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science at Stony Brook, gave a lecture titled “Getting Beyond a Blind Date with Science” on Thursday, Feb. 19 to promote the center’s mission to teach scientists how to effectively connect with audiences about their work. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The talk, which was open to the public and sponsored by the School of Journalism as well as the Alda Center, featured a slew of anecdotes from Alda’s history in science and acting, pressing the importance of his goal to make better communicators out of future scientists and medical professionals.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Alda hosted “Scientific American Frontiers” on PBS from 1993 to 2007, where he interviewed over 700 scientists.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“As far as the public is concerned, we’re really on a blind date with science,” Alda said. “We want to get the public out of that uncomfortable situation of being on a blind date and get them to fall in love with science.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sticking to the theme of love, Alda explained the theory of the three stages of love as a metaphor for how audiences listen to scientists.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You might not even know about the theory of the three stages of love, because I made it up,” Alda said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He said the three stages are attraction, infatuation and commitment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“If we don’t see a thought process going on, we don’t really believe we’re being spoken to,” Alda said. “Real people try to make a connection not only to one another, but to what their inspiration is for their next sentence. And if you see that going on, if there’s real contact with the people you’re talking to, they’re going to pay more attention.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Alda also spoke about the curse of knowledge, which he believes is the major problem for scientists trying to engage the public.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Knowledge is a curse; when you know something so deeply in all its complexity that you forget what it’s like not to know it,” Alda said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To demonstrate this, he called up an audience member to the stage to tap out the rhythm of a song on the podium. The audience had to try to guess what the song was, based solely on the tapping. The volunteer guessed that most of the audience would be able to identify the song prior to the experiment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I think we got like 20–25 percent tops,” Alda said, following the experiment. “Don’t feel bad because most people say 80 percent will get it. When we tap it out, we hear the melody in our head. We’re undergoing the curse of knowledge.”</span></p>
<p class="p1">Another demonstration Alda performed exhibited how telling a story is not enough to connect to an audience.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He asked a volunteer to carry an empty glass from one side of the stage to the other. He then filled the glass to the brim with water and said, “Now you have to carry that glass back across the stage and put it on that table, but don’t spill a drop or your entire village will die.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The audience member successfully carried the glass across the stage.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“OK so which trip across the stage was more engaging?” Alda asked. “Everybody knows there’s no village that’s going to die, but just saying that puts that virtual risk in our heads. It’s enough to make you say, ‘I hope she doesn’t spill that. Is she going to be able to do it?’”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Alda said he also believes humor can be effective in communicating science, “as long as it’s not forced or mechanical. As in all communication, the more spontaneous, the better.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He emphasized how far the Alda Center has come to completing its mission since its inception in 2009.</span></p>
<p class="p1">“We’ve made so much progress in the last four, five years, we’ve gone way past where I thought we’d go way after I was gone,” Alda said. “I didn’t think I’d see this progress until I was dead. We are working hard to establish a network of universities and institutions around the country collaborate with us in teaching the communication of science to both graduate students and senior scientists.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stony Brook University assistant psychology professor Nicholas Eaton, Ph.D., is leading the first large-scale national study of socially-supported transgender youth. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is a disparity in the number of studies on transgender adults and of those on children, as science often focuses on adolescents, Eaton said. Yet, there is still a paucity of such youth studies. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The TransYouth Project, launched by Eaton and colleagues Kristin Olson, Ph.D. and gender expert Aiden Key, works to bring light to a neglected matter. Their paper, “Gender Cognition in Transgender Children,” was recently published in Psychological Science. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">At the crux of the study is the belief that trans children are feigning their sexual identity, a notion the scientific community has long promoted. The study worked to test those presumptions in a scientific way. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Although their gender experiences differ from those of most of the population in terms of how they feel, they don’t differ in terms of their clarity or certainty,” Eaton said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The study consists of interviews with children between the ages of five and 12 years of age, as well as their parents and cisgender, or non-transgender, siblings. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This study differs from others of its kind because those who are studied live fully supported as their gender identity, one that is not the same as their natal sex. They dress for their chosen gender and use corresponding pronouns.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Another approach that separates this study from others is that rather than using only explicit measures, such as self-report type of questions that can easily be answered to fit what they think is the socially acceptable answer, the project uses implicit means.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These implicit means are known as an IAT, or Implicit Association Test, in which subjects are asked to sort pictures of boys and girls with various words that relate to either gender. This method is an unconscious way of obtaining impartial responses. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The results suggest gender-typical girls are quick to associate themselves with girls rather than boys. The same is true of gender-typical boys. The same pattern of results is evident within transgender kids, their siblings, and their controls. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">For many people, the idea of a transgender child can be disconcerting because they often view<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>sex and gender as synonymous ideas, Eaton said. Rather, biological sex is essentially what is assigned at birth, whereas gender is what a person identifies with. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Although the overall number of transgender people is unknown, researchers know that 40 percent of that community will attempt suicide, according to Eaton. This rate is nine times more than that of the general population. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">For teens, problems lie within school bathrooms, locker rooms and sports teams. Through adulthood, transgender people are discriminated against, especially in the workforce, leaving them unemployed or homeless.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Eaton and his colleagues hope to monitor these kids for the long haul, studying them as they evolve from adolescence to maturity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“As a university community—and as a national community more broadly—it is our responsibility to provide transgender individuals with the respect, acceptance, and accommodation they deserve,” Eaton said. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Winter is not over yet at Stony Brook, but most of the key campus construction projects are soldiering on. Besides the construction of the new residence hall on Toll Drive, the renovation of the Pritchard Gymnasium pool and the completion of the new computer science building are still on track. While the Seawolves continue to brave the winter weather, project managers throughout the campus have accounted for the occasional snow day in their planning. In addition, when it comes to time delays and the expected dates for the completion of outdoor campus construction, managers cannot give a definitive answer until the weather breaks.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Toll Drive residence hall</b></span></p>


[caption id="attachment_35991" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-35991 size-medium" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_0752-600x450.jpg" alt="IMG_0752" width="600" height="450" /> <em>HEATHER KHALIFA / THE STATESMAN </em>[/caption]
<p class="p2">The biggest construction project going on right now is the building of a new 757-bed residential building coupled with a 60,000 square foot dining facility on Toll Drive. The project will be completed in two phases—the first phase will see the addition of 302 beds and the dining facility, according to the Facilities and Services website. The second phase will add the other 455 beds. Due to the snow, the construction site is at a standstill and the project can expect to see a 30-day delay. “I don’t want to say there is nothing going on,” Louis Rispoli, associate vice president of facilities and services, said. “There are people working in the basement doing underground plumbing and mechanical work. But the steel has stopped, the decking has stopped, the second phase excavation has stopped. So for all intents and purposes it is really at a standstill, with exceptions of minor work by the mechanical team.”</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Computer Science Building</b></span></p>


[caption id="attachment_35989" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-35989 size-medium" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/02202015_CompSciBuildingSnow_Simon.Sharp_06-600x399.png" alt="02202015_CompSciBuildingSnow_Simon.Sharp_06" width="600" height="399" /> <em>SIMON SHARP / THE STATESMAN </em>[/caption]
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The new computer science building has been under construction since September 2012. “The computer science building continues to work,” Rispoli said. “That’s because all the work that is being done is interior. They have full heating systems working at this point.” The building is expected to open spring of this year. The State University Construction Fund website and the Department of Computer Science website state that construction was originally supposed to be completed in summer or fall of 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Pritchard pool</b></span></p>


[caption id="attachment_35995" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-35995 size-medium" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/KN-TEENS-SWIMMERS-4-MI-1-600x307.jpg" alt="swimming" width="600" height="307" /> <em>STATESMAN STOCK PHOTO</em>[/caption]
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After much anticipation from students, the Pritchard pool renovations are finally underway. Because the renovation is taking place inside the Pritchard Gym, there is no snow delay. What students can expect from the gym is a new pool, deeper water lights, HVHC to control humidity, lighting, acoustics and tile. “It might have missed a day or two, but for the most part maybe a day,” Martin Ryan, project manager of the Pritchard pool, said. “They do a nice job on campus moving the snow. So you just keep moving along; get the job finished.” The pool renovations should be completed by December of 2016. Students should be able to swim by February or March. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Innovation and Discovery Center</b></span></p>


[caption id="attachment_35990" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-35990 size-medium" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/20140910_165837-e1424823860599-600x338.jpg" alt="20140910_165837" width="600" height="338" /> <em>MEGAN MILLER / THE STATESMAN </em>[/caption]
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Once construction starts on the Innovation and Discovery Center, it will become the largest project on campus, according to Rispoli, and will be located in the university’s Research &amp; Development Park. In April 2014, the university received a $60 million appropriation from the New York State budget to construct and design this project. “It’s being built for a collaboration between research and start up companies, which the government has a program out there for it called START-UP NY,” Rispoli said. “We are currently awarding the design contract and we expect to start design this spring.” Once the construction is complete, the center will have 200,000 gross square feet of lab and office spaces. The space can then be used by start-up technology companies looking to take advantage of the START-UP NY benefits, according to a university press release. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Undergraduate Student Government Senate approved a resolution to support a renewed plan for predictable tuition costs for State University of New York schools by a vote of 16-1-0 at its meeting on<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thursday, Feb. 19.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“It’s to ensure that one: we as students can plan our college education with our families, and two: so our university knows how much money they are going to take in so they can plan accordingly,” USG Vice President of Academic Affairs Steven Adelson said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Under the SUNY 2020 legislation, which Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed in 2011, SUNY and CUNY schools were able to increase tuition for in-state students by $300 a year for five years. Therefore, the control on in-state tuition will expire after the next academic year.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stony Brook University President Samuel L. Stanley Jr. said at a meeting with media representative on Wednesday that the legislation ended dramatic and unpredictable spikes in tuition costs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I think [SUNY 2020] has had some advantages for students and their families in that it’s made things predictable,” Stanley said. “You know what your cost is going to be every year. Before we had SUNY 2020, it was tuition roulette. Some years there would be massive tuition increases—20, 30 percent a year. Other years there would be nothing.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stony Brook’s 2011 application for the SUNY 2020 program also stated that Stony Brook would raise tuition 10 percent for out-of-state students.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Adelson said that the money raised from tuition increases under SUNY 2020 were used to hire new faculty, to increase graduate student stipends and to start the Academic Success and Tutoring Center.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">USG’s resolution calls on Cuomo and the state legislature to renew the “rational tuition plan.” The resolution also calls on Stanley, the University Senate and the student governments of all SUNY schools to support the renewal.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The conversations are happening in the state legislature now and this is really going to give us the push that they need to really consider this,” Adelson said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The senate also approved a repeal of Black Womyn’s Association’s removal from line budget status by a vote of 14-3-0. At last week’s senate meeting, the association was removed from line budget status for not holding an event funded by the Student Activity Fee last semester as required by USG’s financial bylaws.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The association’s president, Bianca Baofo, and vice president, Janelle March, claimed that they could not use funds from the Student Activity Fee for an event because of issues with their secretary’s account on Campusvine, the online system used to budget club events.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When USG Treasurer Kathryn Michaud said that every club was required to check that its Campusvine accounts were working at the Leadership Conference in September, Baofo countered that while they were able to log onto their Campusvine accounts, Campusvine would not let them submit a voucher for the event.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We would not have know it was not working unless we made a voucher,” Baofo said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the end of the debate, Sen. Meghan Walsh said that the senate should remember that the Black Womyn’s Association representatives were “students first.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I don’t know about you guys, but if I was the president of a club, but it would very important to me, but it would not be the first thing on my agenda,” Walsh said. “So if a voucher wasn’t going through, and I had a test, I would definitely study for my test before I even showed up to the USG office. I would just like to point out that they made an attempt.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now that the Black Womyn’s Association’s line budget status has been restored, the association will now have to send a budget application to the senate budget committee. The funds for that budget will have to be appropriated through a separate act, Michaud said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The senate also approved the Health and Nutrition Club’s request for line budget status and the Martial Arts Association’s application for a Special Services Council budget of $474.50, as well as officially acknowledging the Stony Brook chapter of Camp Kesem, an organization that puts together a one-week summer camp for children who have parents who have or have had cancer.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

Not everyone thinks about handcuffs and flogs the way that Christian Grey does.

But, they certainly have flocked into movie theaters, bringing $85.2 million to the box office, according to The Guardian. And that was on top of the one-hundred million copies of the original trilogy, according to The New York Times.

Despite its financial success, the film received a 25 percent rating on the tomatometer from Rotten Tomatoes, an organization that showcases the opinions of countless television and film critics. Optimal? Not really.

At its core, the story is simply about two love stricken characters tasked with overcoming an overarching issue: Christian Grey’s sexual preferences.

However, both the book and the film required more research into BDSM and kink.

“BDSM is all about self-policing, and to the common observer there isn’t a difference between what we do and what 'Fifty Shades of Grey' does," Dakota Jordan, the president of Stony Brook TNG, said.

The film centers around the relationship between the innocent recent college-graduate Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) and the unusually young, successful and mysterious Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan).

For starters, those who are into BDSM—or Bondage Dominance Submissive Sadomasochism—know what they are getting into when they reach for their whips and flogs. (No, not all BDSM involves sex toys, or even sex at all.) Safe words are involved. And some even sign contracts with their partners to keep it legal-or as part of the sexy fun time.

Christian stalks her, buys her things without her consent and tries to persuade her to push her sexual limits. Meanwhile, Anastasia is a virgin before she meets Christian and has no idea what kind of limits she is even capable of hitting. Once he shows her what it is like, to be whipped, tied up and to have her limits pushed, he says she will like it.

But of course, she loves him, so she wants to explore this world with him. She thinks she can change him.

That is not a BDSM relationship.

"The whole movie does BDSM wrong, but that's fine because it's a movie and they are not real people doing real BDSM,” Jordan said.

Other members from Stony Brook TNG said the film stirs up confusion about the distinction between an abusive relationship and a dominant/submissive relationship.

Jordan said that the film should not be watched and imitated. One of the many things that she does not like about the film is that it fails to illustrate a proper dominant/submissive relationship where safe words are always used and the other is respected.

College students joke about them all the time, but safe words are a real facet of BDSM and kink relationships. They are words that partners both know before they get started that if uttered means that something has to stop.

In the movie, Christian gives Anastasia a contract in which he lists the safe words “red” and “yellow” for her to use. However, Anastasia never signs the contract.

In the film she never officially agrees to be his submissive, therefore Christian trying to push her to do things sexually with him is not proper BDSM because it is not consensual.

According to members of Stony Brook TNG, until a duo has agreed on what their limits are and what they like or dislike, they are not in a proper BDSM relationship.

As part of the clubs efforts to inform students about safe sex, they list the phrase “enthusiastic consent” when talking about sexual scripting.

Ashley Barry, the vice president of Stony Brook TNG, said that she is bothered by the way the movie presents itself like it is the norm.

“I don’t think people are going to separate it from education,” Barry said about how women will watch the film and think it is behavior they will want to try, but will not be safe about it.

Christian is a dominant one in the bedroom. By having his submissive sign a contract, which Anastasia never actually signs in the movie or the books, he knows that they will play by his rules and he is in charge.

“One of the biggest things that scared me in '50 Shades of Grey' is that he forces her to go on certain types of birth control,” Barry said when talking about the conditions in Christian's contract. Barry also gave the example that in Christian’s contract, it states that the sub needs to work out and limit the amount of alcohol or drugs they use. She said that it would only be okay if both people agreed with these conditions.

"Instead he has her sign a contract that's like 'I can control you in all ways shapes and forms,’” Barry said.

Jordan presented an example of a “sex list” commonly used by couples who partake in BDSM relationships and said that the movie would be much better if Christian’s list was more like that.

What it came down to for Jordan was defining the rights of the dominant and the submissive.

Christian's sadism or sexual fetishes are not the problem, she said. It is his lack of understanding of people’s rights. The main issue with the relationship portrayed in the film is that it does not play by regular BDSM rules and consents.

Jordan also said that just because the film depicts BDSM incorrectly does not mean that it is not okay for other people to enjoy it. However, she mentioned that people are lazy and may not be safe about attempting a BDSM type relationship, though she does not believe the book can be pegged as the sole cause for it.

"I don't want to invalidate its right to be a thing, it's just a bad thing” she said about the film.]]></content:encoded>

No, Roland Nyama was not in the building, but the three-point ball was still on fire for the Seawolves on Sunday afternoon. This time, it was senior Sabre Proctor who hit a couple of long-range bombs to change the momentum and lead a deep-ball barrage, catapulting the Stony Brook’s women’s basketball team on a second-half surge to beat Albany, 68-64. It was only fitting that it was Proctor and senior Jessica Ogunnorin, who hit a late three-pointer and a free throw that gave the Seawolves breathing room, that got the job done on their Senior Night at Island Federal Credit Union Arena.

Head Coach Caroline McCombs’ described both Proctor and Ogunnorin’s play on both ends of the floor, which contributed to ending Albany’s 30-game in-conference road winning streak, as “special moments”.

“Those were key moments where we needed plays to be made and they were able to make them,” she said.

When both McCombs and Albany’s Head Coach Katie Abrahamson-Henderson drew up their respective game plans before the contest, both more than likely heavily incorporated their best players, Proctor and junior Shereesha Richards of the Great Danes.

However, early foul trouble for both teams virtually eliminated them from the first half.

Two apiece only allowed Proctor to stay on the court for five minutes, while Richards had to take a seat after eight.

That forced a sloppy, grind-it-out opening 20 minutes in which the Seawolves and Great Danes combined for 23 turnovers. Albany pressed Stony Brook, putting pressure on any and all Seawolves ball-handlers, while McCombs’ team played tight defense on the other end.

In the second half, with both stars back on the floor, it looked as if Richards would show why she deserved to win the America East Player of the Year once again after taking it last season.

She dominated down low early on, before the Seawolves adjusted.

“She takes five players to guard her and so we were able to stay with the game plan as their guards made some shots,” McCombs said. “We just stayed the course.”

When they made headway in shutting down the most potent offensive threat for the Great Danes, it was because of sending double-and-triple teams Richards’ way, forcing her into bad shots or team turnovers.

Proctor on the other hand came out firing in the second half, scoring 17 of her 21 points in the final 20 minutes.

“I just wanted to stay composed and I wanted to keep my team together,” Proctor said. “We just wanted to stay composed and wanted to get stops and try to score on the offensive end.”

That she did, pacing her team to their biggest win of the season.

Junior Brittany Snow finished with 17 points and seven rebounds while sophomore Kori Bayne-Walker tallied 14 points and five assists while breaking the press of the Great Danes.

It was a great follow-up to what was a solid performance for Stony Brook on Wednesday night. The Seawolves scored only 15 points in the first half of their game against UMass-Lowell in Island Federal Credit Union Arena.

It took them just 6:05 in the second half to do the same, and it was their energy coming out in the second half that propelled the Seawolves to a win over the River Hawks.

After only scoring 49 points in a tough loss the game before against the top team in the America East Conference, Maine, pouring in 47 in the second half alone was an impressive feat.

Snow, who is always a menace on the glass, nearly outscored the entire UMass-Lowell team by herself in an efficient second twenty minutes.

After staying quiet on the scoreboard, grabbing five boards in the first, Snow heated up those who came into Island FCU Arena from the cold with 17 points on 8-of-10 shooting.

She had 19 on the night, helping earn a big conference win.

The Seawolves will look to secure the third seed for the America East Tournament with two road games to close out what has been an up-and-down regular season slate.

A win over either Binghamton or Hartford will do the trick, as McCombs and company charge full steam ahead into March.]]></content:encoded>

Stony Brook men’s lacrosse hosted the NJIT Highlanders’ first Division I lacrosse game in school history this Friday. The Seawolves were dominant on both sides of the ball, winning the match handily, with a final score of 18-4.

Stony Brook struck early, as sophomore midfielder Alex Corpolongo buried a shot within the first two minutes of the game off an assist from junior Chris Hughes.

Corpolongo ended the day with a hat trick, equals the amount of goals he scored all of last season.

“I was just hungry from the end of the season last year to get after it. I know we have a good group of guys. I just want to be a part of making a difference on the team and doing something special this year,” Corpolongo said.

The team kept its momentum up throughout the first quarter, with goals from last year’s team point leader, senior Mike Rooney, another from Corpolongo, junior Matt Schultz and junior Brody Eastwood, the team’s leading goal scorer for the previous two seasons.

Stony Brook’s defense also started off the game at a scorching pace, as NJIT failed to attempt a shot or win a face-off all throughout the first quarter.

“We were just kind of working out what we worked on all week, which was time of possession and sharing on defense. We didn’t really get a lot of looks on defense, but the guys did a nice job possessing the ball,” coach Jim Nagle said.

Schultz scored two quick goals to start off the second quarter, both of which came within the first five minutes of play. Schultz finished the day with four goals, two assists and picking up six groundballs.

This was the second four-goal game of the junior’s career, the other coming during last year’s game at Fairfield in which he tallied seven points.

“I’ve been shooting pretty poorly lately, so I was just trying to take reps after practice and before practice and honestly, I was just focused on hustling today and just trying to make plays all over the field,” Schultz said.

“I feel like once I kind of lit a fire under my butt, just to run and ride hard, and just trying to get ground balls in the beginning and then my shots started falling. It was good to see them in the back of the net,” he added.

With a score of 8-1 Stony Brook at the half, Nagle found playing time for the underclassmen and non-starters on the team.

Freshman midfielder McLean Chicquen, freshman midfielder Derek Lloyd and sophomore attack Chris Stemke all recorded their first goals in a Stony Brook uniform.

“[It was] a really good day for us to play a lot of kids that have been practicing, and working hard and not have opportunity to play in a game. That was the biggest plus for us, as well as the way I thought our guys were sportsmen like today, so I was really happy,” Nagle said.

Other goal scorers included junior attack Challen Rogers, sophomore midfielder Ryan Bitzer and junior midfielder Jake Sichenzia. NJIT made a late run, putting three consecutive goals in the back of the net during the fourth quarter, but that proved to be too little, too late.

“We just got to continue to play and work hard within our system and believe in what we’re doing. I think that when you start doing that, you’ll see some of those late breakdowns disappear,” Nagle said.

Freshman attack Jake Sheets lead the team with three assists, while sophomore midfielder Jay Lindsay recovered seven ground balls and went 9-11 on his face-offs.

Stony Brook came into the game suffering from a tough loss to St. John’s, during which the Red Storm went on a 7-0 end game run to take the win. “[St. John’s] was a really tough loss for us because we were just disappointed in the way we finished it, the character in which we finished,” Nagle said. “It feels good to get a win under your belt, but really, we weren’t really tested today, so we’re really looking to show what we can do and get that out of our memories on Sunday.”

This team was looking forward to a matchup with the two-time defending national champion Blue Devils at Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium, but Duke was unable to get out of Durham, N.C. due to the weather that has hit most of the country the past two weeks. The matchup will now take place on April 15 at 7 p.m., with both teams getting a break from conference play.

Their next matchup is at home against Fairfield on Feb. 28, as they host the Stags at 7 p.m.]]></content:encoded>

STATESMAN STOCK PHOTO" width="600" height="429" /></a> Stony Brook's baseball team fell short again for the consecutive week, bringing its record to 2-4. <em>STATESMAN STOCK PHOTO</em>[/caption]

For the second consecutive week, the Seawolves (2-4) dropped a series on the road in the state of Louisiana, this time to the Louisiana-Lafayette Ragin’ Cajuns (4-3).

The weekend got off to a dreary start Friday evening, as the Seawolves jumped out to an early 3-0 lead, before allowing seven unanswered runs en route to a 7-3 defeat. Things fell apart for ace Tyler Honahan in the fifth inning, as he allowed three runs in that frame alone.

Tagged with the loss was reliever Chad Lee, who allowed four earned runs in the sixth inning, putting Stony Brook in a four-run hole it could not crawl out of.

Due to the weather expected on Sunday, the series finale was moved up to Saturday evening, making for the Seawolves’ first doubleheader of the year.

There would be no letdown from the pitching staff during the two games on Saturday, as they allowed a combined three runs.

The first of those to be stealthy was sophomore Daniel Zamora, who had his second-consecutive impressive start. He retired the first 14 batters he would face before polishing off six innings of work, also striking out seven batters and allowing just a single run.

In relief, side-winding freshman left-hander Teddy Rodliff slammed the door going the final three frames while allowing just a single hit and walk, with no runners crossing the plate for the three-inning save.

The early game would be the only one of the series where the Seawolves’ bats came out scorching. Seven of the nine starters got hits, including multi-hit efforts from junior Jack Parenty and senior Cole Peragine.

The name of the game was making contact, as Stony Brook struck out just twice the entire game, forcing the Ragin’ Cajuns into making three errors on the defensive side of the ball en route to a 4-1 victory that evened up the series.

In the rubber match, the lack of punch in the Seawolves’ bats came back to bite them.

Mustering just three hits in their second game of the day, one run was not enough cushion for the pitching, no matter how stingy they were.

Charged with the loss was junior Edwin Corniel, but it was sophomore closer Cameron Stone who gave up the game-clinching hit in the bottom of the eighth, leading to the Seawolves’ 2-1 loss.

It was the second-consecutive convincing start from junior Tim Knesnik, who tossed four innings and allowed just three hits and two walks, along with just one run, as he earned a no decision.

The only Seawolf to have a hit in all three games was senior second baseman Robert Chavarria. After an opening weekend where the lineup featured no changes, the same remained true in the second consecutive weekend in Louisiana.

Next up for Stony Brook is a journey down to Gainesville, Fla., for a collision with the national powerhouse Florida Gators. After losing their first two series, the Seawolves will be matched up with a top-5 Gators squad.]]></content:encoded>

HEATHER KHALIFA / THE STATESMAN[/caption]

Not even the pounding snowfall outside could stop Seawolves freshman Roland Nyama from heating up on Saturday night. Nyama scored 22 points on 6-of-7 shooting from deep to propel Stony Brook to a 64-52 victory at home over Binghamton.

“It was a good week. 2-0, we beat the number one team in our conference and we beat a good Binghamton team,” Jameel Warney, who scored 11 points and collected eight boards, said following the win. “We’re just happy we got better over this week.”

Coming off a major win at Albany, Stony Brook needed a win against the Bearcats to maintain its standing as the third seed. The Seawolves took an early 9-2 lead out of the gate behind an opening-possession three from who else but Nyama and three turnovers in a little over four minutes from Binghamton.

The Bearcats opened play in a zone, but would switch throughout the night, sometimes playing man, pressing and trapping full-court in different sequences to throw Stony Brook off.

“They did a great job against Vermont doing that stuff,” Head Coach Steve Pikiell said. “When you do that kind of defense, you give up a lot of things and you get some things, too. They’re second in the league in steals, but then they give up open jumpshots, lay-ups and fouls. Have to take advantage of what they’re doing. I thought [Carson Puriefoy] did a real good job of handling a lot of different looks and still moving the ball where it needs to be moved.”

Puriefoy was able to get a slew of open court opportunities by slicing through the backcourt pressure, scoring a team-high 10 points in the opening half.

However, this is not to say Stony Brook excelled on the offensive end in the first 20 minutes. After making four of their first five shots, the Seawolves went into a drought in the wake of Binghamton’s stifling defense.

Having trouble crossing midcourt, SBU shot just 3-14 in an eight-minute stretch following its strong start. Warney could only get involved when Binghamton went to strictly man, but even during the few times that occurred he was promptly double- and triple-teamed.

The Bearcats failed to take control with turnovers killing their offensive possessions. The Seawolves adjusted to Binghamton’s defense, sparking a 12-4 run in the final minutes of the first half to hold a five-point advantage at the break.

The second half quickly turned into the Nyama show, as the freshman poured in back-to-back-to-back threes in the opening three minutes of the period.

“I would love to say I could shoot last year,” Nyama said. “It was something I really worked on during my redshirt year.”

Following this 11-0 run capped off by a Deshaun Thrower score, Pikiell sat Nyama down and Binghamton responded with a 10-2 run of its own.

However, Nyama’s energy once again sparked a massive 19-5 run to put the Seawolves in the driver’s seat for good.

“I think we have some good shooters and Roland when he gets it going he’s as good as any of them,” Pikiell said. “When Jameel gets double-teamed and someone’s going to be open we made the extra pass today, he was the beneficiary of it. I loved his energy, I thought his defense more importantly was really good. Everyone sees the shots go in but the guys he was guarding have been averaging 15, 16 points a game and he did a real good job of keeping guys in front of him and getting some active rebounds.“

Nyama came away with a steal and a slam, as well as another couple of threes.

“Thing is, I really don’t realize it until my teammates keep feeding me the ball. We had 16 assists today and all my makes came off assists. It’s just great to know that my teammates believe in me and keep giving me the ball,” Nyama said. “At the end of the day if I have 20 plus or a good game, it’s really because my teammates make my job a lot easier.” Hartford’s loss on Friday night clinched a postseason home game for the Seawolves, who now look to close out their regular season with UMass-Lowell and Hartford ahead on the schedule.

“We can’t drop these next two games,” Warney said of the challenge ahead. “It doesn’t matter if we have a home game if we’re playing bad basketball to get there.”]]></content:encoded>

KELLY ZEGERS / THE STATESMAN" width="600" height="400" /></a> Under Head Coach Spallina, the Seawolves roughed up the USC Trojans on Saturday with a 7-4 win. <em>KELLY ZEGERS / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

USC was not the Bucknell team that the Stony Brook women’s lacrosse team dismantled in an 18-1 blitzing on opening day last season. Yet, Head Coach Joe Spallina’s Seawolves handled the Trojans just the same, beating a much better Trojans squad by a score of 7-4.

USC previously lost to the No. 5 team in the country, the Northwestern Wildcats. Spallina made it a point before the season to tout the strength of his team’s offense, but it was the aggressive nature of the Seawolves’ zone defense that suffocated the Trojans.

“We knew our defense was going to be the thing today,” Spallina said. “It’s a great first ‘W’ against a great opponent, well-coached, great athletes and beating Southern Cal, USC, is a nice ‘W’ for Stony Brook.”

As the Seawolves welcomed a team from across the country in their first game, they brought in a local tradition to account for giving the team credit for their performance.

Like the New York Rangers, Spallina and company are welcoming the Broadway Hat tradition to the team. Whoever gets the hat will than be able to sign it, decorate it and add their own touch to it, spreading the wealth of the victory rather than just letting those who show up in the papers shine.

“I think it’s a lot of times the kids who show up on the stat sheet get a lot of the love,” Spallina said. “We’re not taking away from that, but we’re going to give [it to] an offensive player, a defensive player and than an unsung hero each game.”

On Saturday afternoon, however, the hat was not a necessity to show the few fans in attendance on a frigid day at Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium that the Seawolves could put in a complete team performance.

That includes a couple of newcomers to Stony Brook, as freshmen Kylie Ohlmiller and Samantha DiSalvo were both all over the field.

“Our incoming freshmen this year, they play a big role,” sophomore Dorrien Van Dyke said. “Sam DiSalvo, she gets up and down the field, plays offense and defense well. Kylie, she is a sick attacker, she can get the shot off at any level, behind her back, when she’s mid-fall, she can just do it all.”

It may not have showed in her numbers for the game, but it was DiSalvo who was playing a very Michelle Rubino-esque game.

At one moment, she would be in the attacking third, keeping the ball cycling throughout the offense. The next, back on the defensive end, rushing to whomever held the ball for the opposing Trojans.

In the third of the field that many do not track as closely, DiSalvo held down the midfield, fighting for every ground ball. She would scoop up two in the contest.

Ohlmiller, who Spallina said could be among Tewaaraton Award favorites as the best player in the nation by the time her career comes to an end, did not end up tallying her first career goal for the Seawolves.

Instead, she did everything else to help her team win. Many if not all of Stony Brook’s possessions went through the newcomer, and she contributed two assists.

She almost notched her first as a Seawolf with a highlight-reel worthy shot while falling over just outside of the crease, but the goal was disallowed by the referees for an illegal stick.

One of Stony Brook’s key defenders, redshirt junior Maegan Meritz, who was named to the America East’s Second Team last season, showed toughness all game long. She was hit hard twice in the face, yet still managed to get after it aggressively, helping keep the Trojans’ offense in check.

“That’s really a tribute to the way she plays,” Spallina said about Meritz’s positioning on the field. “A year ago or two years ago she would have gotten her stick there and fouled somebody, now she’s getting her body in those areas.”

Surprising nobody were Van Dyke and fellow sophomore Courtney Murphy, who topped the scoring list for freshmen across the nation last season. Both scored two goals in the solid season-opening win.

		<title>Head Coach Joe Spallina has contract extended thru 2019</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Since being hired as Head Coach of the Stony Brook women’s lacrosse team back in June of 2012, Joe Spallina has brought nothing but success to the program. Under his leadership the team has won two NCAA tournament games, nailed down a pair of America East tournament championships and produced three IWLCA All-Americans.

Spallina’s positive influence on the Seawolves has not gone unnoticed. Just one day before the team’s season opener, the Stony Brook Athletics Department made the decision to ensure that the program’s all-time winningest coach will be in the fold for years to come.

Director of Athletics Shawn Heilbron announced on Friday that the university has extended Spallina’s contract through June of 2019.

“Joe has worked tirelessly to establish Stony Brook as one of the top women’s lacrosse programs in the country, and I am thrilled he will continue to lead our student-athletes towards even greater heights.” Heilbron said in a statement. “Long Island is a national hotbed for lacrosse, and Joe is a homegrown product who has done a phenomenal job of turning Stony Brook into a premier destination for top talent.”

Spallina now enters his fourth season at the helm for the SBU women’s lacrosse team after spending four years coaching at Adelphi. The Seawolves are 49-12 overall, and 15-2 in conference play, with him as Head Coach.

One of the biggest reasons Spallina decided to sign the contract extension was his faith in the man leading the university’s Athletics department.

“It came down to that I believe in the Athletics Director. Shawn is lights out,” Spallina said on Saturday, after his team’s season opening victory. “I know he’s a huge proponent of our program, giving us every resource that USC, or Ohio State, or any one of the big programs have.”

Spallina also lives on Long Island, where he and his wife have four kids, and a fifth on the way. The extension allows him to stay put in a place where his family is comfortable while also giving him an opportunity to coach a team that can potentially be a contender in the NCAA tournament for years to come.

“There’s no place I’d rather be,” Spallina said. “I know I can get it done here. I know we will get it done here.”]]></content:encoded>

[caption id="attachment_24915" align="alignleft" width="500"]<a href="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Stony-Brook-Basketball-Womens-vs-Albany-1_30_14-by-Basil-John-e1394577823512.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-24915" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Stony-Brook-Basketball-Womens-vs-Albany-1_30_14-by-Basil-John-500x333.jpg" alt="The performance of junior Brittany Snow has been one of the biggest reasons for her her team's strong play of late. BASIL JOHN / THE STATESMAN" width="500" height="333" /></a> The performance of junior Brittany Snow has been one of the biggest reasons for her team's strong play as of late. <em>BASIL JOHN / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

<em><strong>Point #1: Stony Brook’s road win over Albany was huge.</strong></em>

Through this regular season’s highs and lows, little has measured up to the challenge that the Seawolves will most likely face come March: playing and beating Albany on the road in SEFCU Arena in the postseason. The Great Danes were 12-0 in conference play before SBU took a trip to the state’s capital and handed them their first loss.

Although this was just one win, it has a few implications. For one, this win gives Stony Brook a seeding advantage by giving the Seawolves the edge over New Hampshire, which has the same conference record and has split its series with SBU. Secondly, the win could give the Seawolves confidence heading into a postseason meeting with Albany, having already beaten the Great Danes once.

Although Peter Hooley is still working to get back into game form and it took a breakout performance from Scott King to win the contest, Stony Brook’s victory is a stark message to the world and themselves that no team can feel safe facing off against its squad.

<em><strong>Point #2: The SBU women’s basketball team is heating up at the right time.</strong></em>

With the America East tournament quickly approaching, the Stony Brook women’s basketball team finds itself playing its best basketball of the season. The Seawolves have excelled in conference play as of late, winning seven of their last nine games.

The team’s offensive play has been the driving force behind its recent hot stretch. Stony Brook has scored at least 60 points in each of their previous seven wins. Over the team’s first 18 games, SBU failed to reach the 60-point mark 10 times.

Christa Scognamiglio has been a big reason for the team’s increased offensive output. The sophomore forward has scored in double-digit figures in six of the team’s past seven.

Kori Bayne-Walker is thriving in the role as the team’s main distributor. The sophomore leads the America East in assists per game during conference play.

The one knock against Stony Brook entering this weekend, was that they have struggled when some of the conference’s top teams. But, on Sunday the Seawolves put those concerns to rest when they defeated conference powerhouse Albany.

Over the past nine games Stony Brook has proved that their capable of beating anyone in the America East. Now they will have to sustain this high level of play through the America East tournament in March.

<em><strong>Point #3: The Seawolves thrive when redshirt freshman Roland Nyama thrives.</strong></em>

Stony Brook is now 7-2 when Nyama scores ten or more points and 3-0 when he scores 20 or more. These are select games in a long season, but those numbers are hard to ignore, especially when you factor in that the Seawolves are 13-3 when three players score in double-digits.

Although it is nearly impossible for SBU to die by Nyama’s game, with him consistently playing strong defense and oozing energy on the court, the Seawolves sure can live by him when he is on his game. Nyama is now the most efficient shooter on the team statistically, so the only thing left is getting him to actually shoot.

On some nights, Nyama will take any foot of space and let it fly to much success. Nyama is shooting just under 40 percent from deep in games where he takes three or more threes. On other nights, he stays gun-shy both from distance and in looking for seams and lanes to the hoop.

He is still only a freshman, but as unfair as it sounds, Stony Brook will desperately need Nyama to look for his shot and knock it down come the postseason.

<em><strong>Point #4: The Seawolves will need Proctor to be at the top of her game in order to succeed in March.</strong> </em>

No one can argue that Sabre Proctor has put together a fantastic season this year for Stony Brook. Coming into Sunday, her 14.9 points per game ranked fourth-highest in the conference, and her 6.7 rebounds per game ranked eighth highest in the America East. She has also managed to reach double-digit point totals in 21 games.

But, during some of the Seawolves biggest conference matchups this season, Proctor has failed to deliver.

This was the case in the team’s 57-49 loss to Maine on Feb. 15. The senior shot only 1-of-7 from the floor, and totaled just three points in a game in which her team was in need of an offensive boost, against one of the conference’s top defenses.

Proctor also struggled offensively in Stony Brook’s 60-58 loss to Hartford back on Jan. 29. She shot only 2-of-7 from the field, scoring just seven points in her team’s one possession defeat.

On Sunday against Albany it was a much different story for Proctor. She led the team with 21 points, shooting 7-of-9 from the field and was a major difference maker for the Seawolves.

Stony Brook's recent matchups against some of the conference's elite teams have showcased that the Seawolves will go as far as Proctor will carry them.

When Proctor is on her game, SBU is capable of beating any America East foe they encounter. When she is not, winning becomes a much more difficult task for the team.

The bottom line is that if the Seawolves are to make a deep postseason run, they will need their best player, Proctor, to play as well as she did on Sunday against the Great Danes.]]></content:encoded>

The Stony Brook softball team kicked off its 2015 season this past weekend in the Florida Gulf Coast Tournament. The team saw mixed results in their opening weekend, as the Seawolves picked up wins in two out of their five games.

The season opener was a rough outing for Stony Brook, as the team fell 8-1 to Oakland. Senior Shayla Giosia solo home run in the fourth inning would be the lone offensive bright spot in the game for SBU.

The Golden Grizzlies had a pair of big innings, scoring four runs in both the third and sixth inning. Junior Jane Sallen gave up eight runs on eight hits, as she picked up the loss in her first start of 2015.

The second game was noticeably better for Stony Brook. Up against Bethune-Cookman, the Seawolves were able to rally with two outs in the bottom of the seventh to even the score and send the game to extra innings.

The Seawolves won the game 3-2, thanks to a walk-off RBI double by Patty Borges in the ninth. Freshman Maddy Neales pitched 3.2 innings for Stony Brook, giving up two runs on four hits, walking three and striking out two. Sallen came in for relief and pitched 5.1 innings with only one hit and four strikeouts.

Day two of the tournament would be another split for the Seawolves. Stony Brook took on Purdue in the first game on Saturday.

The Seawolves jumped out to an early 2-0 lead in the bottom of the first inning on a two-run RBI single off the bat of Giosia, but the lead would not stand as they allowed Purdue to comeback and tie the game.

In the bottom of the sixth, the Seawolves took the lead once again, this time off the bat of Bria Green. Green knocked Giosia home with the game-winning single.

Sallen got the win for Stony Brook, in the team’s 3-2 victory. She went seven innings and allowing only two runs on eight hits. Stony Brook’s record fell to 2-2 after a 9-6 loss in the fourth game of the tournament against Oakland for the second time.

The Seawolves quickly fell behind, 4-0, after the first inning after the Golden Grizzlies played a lot of small ball.

Stony Brook tied the game in the top of the fifth after an RBI double by junior Melissa Phelan and a two-run home run off the bat of Green.

The Seawolves took a one-run lead in the top of the sixth, but the Golden Grizzlies plated four in the bottom of the sixth, making the score 9-6.

SBU finished the tournament 2-3 after a five-inning, 10-2 loss to Florida Gulf Coast.

Stony Brook has more baseball in the Sunshine State ahead of them. Next weekend they will head to Jacksonville to participate in the North Florida Tournament.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[JT Hall had an open shot in front, and he did not waste the championship-winning chance. Brendan Calello had the puck in the corner and chipped it out in front of the net where Hall was waiting to give the Stony Brook club hockey team its third straight ESCHL championship in overtime, winning it 5-4 on Sunday afternoon.

The championship game had all of the drama a title game should, as the Seawolves overcame an early 2-0 deficit for the second-straight game. After falling behind, Stony Brook put together four straight goals, two in the second and two in the third, to take a 4-2 lead.

Tyler Underhill was able to snipe a shot top shelf past Dylan Troiano, who had a fantastic game going for 48 saves.

Sam Brewster was able to put the team up 3-2 with a similar shot, but after the Seawolves got their fourth, UD made a comeback.

The rally was capped with 90 seconds remaining, when Paul Zucker put a rebound off the boards past a diving Derek Willms to tie the score at four.

After close to two-thirds of the overtime period had evaporated, it looked as if the Seawolves were not going to convert a chance, but it was Hall who saved them and their streak of titles with the winner.

In the semifinals Saturday afternoon, it was Hall and Brewster stealing the show, as the Hall set up Brewster three times for a goal, including the game-winner in a 6-2 win.

The Lake Grove, N.Y. native also added a goal of his own in the victory.

After falling behind 2-0 in the first period, the Seawolves scored five goals in a row to seize control and avoid an upset bid.

It was Brewster who gave the Seawolves the lead for good earlier in the period, scoring the first of his three goals when he wound up and ripped one top shelf from the left face-off circle. He would later score on a 2 on 1 with Hall and an empty netter, which the forward also assisted on.]]></content:encoded>

Before heading to the much anticipated America East tournament, Stony Brook men’s basketball will play its final two regular season games this week.

On Wednesday, the Seawolves will play their final regular season home game against UMass-Lowell. Four days later, they will head across the sound to play Hartford in their final regular season game.
Should Stony Brook win Wednesday night, it would be their 20th win of the season. This would mark the fifth time in the last six years the Seawolves recorded 20 wins, something they had failed to do from 1991-2009.

In order to secure that 20th win, the Seawolves will need to continue their dominance in the rebounding department. Forwards Jameel Warney and Rayshaun McGrew are the top two rebounders in the America East this season, and they have been the primary reason Stony Brook leads the conference in rebounding margin.

Conversely, UMass-Lowell has the second worst rebounding differential in the conference. They have been outrebounded all year on offense and defense. This provides Stony Brook with a significant statistical advantage. Grabbing boards on both sides of the ball will be pivotal in determining the final score.

When the Seawolves head to Hartford, they will be facing a team that is stunningly average. They are fifth in the conference in offense, defense and scoring margin this season while holding a 13-14 record. With this being the case, Stony Brook will need to utilize its strength on defense. The Seawolves rank second in the conference in scoring defense, holding opponents to just under 60 points per game.

However, Stony Brook has struggled on the road. Despite a 12-2 home record, the Seawolves are just 7-8 on the road. They will need to put their past road struggles behind them come Saturday night. Winning a road game to close out the season could provide a significant boost of momentum heading into the conference tournament.

The Seawolves are currently tied for third in the America East with New Hampshire, as both are 10-4 in conference play. They are three games behind Albany and one behind Vermont. With only two games left, moving up to the two seed would take two wins and two Vermont losses.

Although moving upwards in the standings is unlikely, Stony Brook will need to win these games if they want to keep and secure the third seed.]]></content:encoded>

[caption id="attachment_35959" align="alignleft" width="350"]<a href="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ENTER_MOVIE-OSCARS_143_LA.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-35959" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ENTER_MOVIE-OSCARS_143_LA-400x600.jpg" alt="Julianne Moore did not receive many positive reactions to her outfit, being marked as one of the worst dressed.

Despite seeing who will gain the obvious prestige that comes with winning an Oscar, one of the most coveted awards in the film industry, many viewers tune in to the Academy Awards solely for the fashion. Viewers want to see what celebrities are sporting on the red carpet before it is all over Instagram in selfie-form.

As rain and clouds graced the 300-foot long red carpet leading to the Dolby Theater, spectators were still countless in number. Umbrellas became a necessary accessory of the night.

Some of the most standout trends so far have been metallic colors, plunging necklines, snowy bright-whites, menswear for women and the predictable go-to black dresses.

Interviewers were discouraged from asking the classic and deemed-sexist  “Who are you wearing?” Instead, the #AskHerMore campaign had the women of the red carpet talking about their struggles, dreams and future career moves.

By far, a favorite of the night was Lupita Nyong’o. Her dress, a custom-made Calvin Klein, was embellished with six thousand pearls. Unlike last year, Nyong’o presented an award and looked flawless as she delivered her lines. The ivory hue of the pearls made her radiate a warm glow. Comments on her dress ranged from how original and beautiful it was to how heavy it must me, according to Twitter and publications like Cosmopolitan. The back of the gown had a beautifully shaped cutout. Her hair and makeup was simple so as not to outshine her gorgeous gown.

As always, despite the fact that Chrissy Teigen is simply a guest of husband John Legend, she effortlessly steals the show. Her Zuhair Murad gown was elegant and sexy all at once, with a high slit revealing dangerous amounts of thigh.  A deep cranberry-colored lipstick complimented the silvery shade of her dress. Simple hair with soft waves and thin-strap heels completed the look.

Julianne Moore, known for her realistic and sensitive portrayal of early-onset Alzheimer’s disease in "Still Alice," disappointed on the red carpet. The straight, boxy shape of the gown and the pale white shade did nothing to bring out her natural beauty. The embellishments that created four horizontal lines on her dress were vaguely reminiscent of sushi. By far, not her best look.

Robin Roberts, a host and interviewer on the red carpet from ABC, looked incredible in a solid, sequined pomegranate-shade gown. She definitely proved that you do not need to be an influential star in the film industry to be a standout on the red carpet. Her luxurious look was daring with an eye-catching cutout on her lower back and a sweeping hemline. She interviewed the celebrities and complimented their looks, but Roberts herself was trending on Twitter.

As not to neglect the men of the night, it is crucial to highlight the importance of the colored tuxedo on the carpet. David Oyelowo drew all eyes to him, taking a risk in a bold crimson tux. Following with the colored tux theme, Eddie Redmayne wore an unexpected blue and black ensemble. Even the host of the night, Neil Patrick Harris, changed into a red tux.

Here is a list of some of the best and worst dressed of the night.

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

Top 5 Best Dresses:
<ol>
	<li>  Anna Kendrick</li>
	<li>  Chrissy Teigen</li>
	<li>  Rosamund Pike</li>
	<li>  Lupita Nyong’o</li>
	<li>  Felicity Jones</li>
</ol>
Top 5 Worst Dresses:
<ol>
	<li>     Margaret Avery</li>
	<li>     Julianne Moore</li>
	<li>     Marion Cotillard</li>
	<li>     Naomi Watts</li>
	<li>     Lorelei Linklater</li>
</ol>

		<title>Brookfest atmosphere not exactly perfect for rock music</title>

USG faced notable backlash on social media following the cancellation of the Streetlight Manifesto concert that was set to take place late last month. It is the thought of many, including myself, that given the prominence of rap, hip-hop and EDM artists at campus concerts and in popular culture as a whole, rock music is often an afterthought when it comes time to decide the line-ups for campus concerts. The largest of these, Brookfest, is no exception. Is that really a bad thing, though? I say no.

As a rock lover, I would be pleased to find out that a rock band was headlining Brookfest. Beyond my affection for rock, I am also a fan of dubstep and EDM and even though I would prefer rock, it is best for those types of music and their artists to be given a degree of priority in the booking process simply because they apply to a broader demographic. Yes, Childish Gambino and Diplo may have been a controversial choice in 2014, but unless you still consider Maroon 5 a rock group and not a pop group, there are quite few rock artists in the broad public consciousness today that would fit the atmosphere of Brookfest. I was sorely disappointed at the cancellation of the Streetlight concert and would like to see more rock artists here in the future, but on the big night, LaValle should house a line-up that draws the biggest crowds and breeds the most excitement. Nowadays, rock is just less likely to do that.

This is not to say that there are not massive problems in the selection process. In my opinion, the secretive nature in which USG decides the Brookfest line-up is what leaves a significant number of students feeling burned by the decision.

Fanning the flames further, USG even joked on Twitter “Diplo was great but in 2015, Nothing Was The Same so just Shake it Off” It’s one thing to pragmatically "shake" off the desires of a vocal minority of rock fans; it is another thing entirely to patronize students with jokes like this, when we’re more than likely to be treated to another year of b-list rappers anyway. Instead of joking and hinting about possible headliners, publicize the options. The undergraduate community should be at least partially consulted.

Maybe there is enough of a following on campus that a number of rock artists could, and maybe a rock artist should, headline the event, but until USG reaches out to the community at large, its decisions will only be criticized more harshly. I think that rap, EDM and pop artists are a safe choice, but if you do not agree, you would be hard-pressed to find a way to influence the decision, and that is indicative of a bigger problem.]]></content:encoded>

The Seawolves look for their next victory against the Bearcats again on Feb. 26. <em>BASIL JOHN / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

The Stony Brook women’s basketball team will look to finish off the regular season on a positive note, with a pair of away games on Feb. 26 and March 1 against Binghamton and Hartford, respectively.

In the first game against the Bearcats this season, the Seawolves owned the glass, out-rebounding their opponents 46-21 in a 67-54 win. Senior Sabre Proctor had a big day, leading the team in scoring with 14 points. She also grabbed six rebounds.

Kori Bayne-Walker had a solid game herself, putting up 13 points to go with eight assists.

The key to the victory laid in the paint. Stony Brook scored 38 of its 67 points within the paint, while Binghamton only scored 10 points in the paint. If the Seawolves can control the paint as much as they did in January, there should be no problem with having control of the whole game.

The first game against Hartford was a much tighter contest. Despite strong outings from Bayne-Walker and Kim Hanlon with 11 points apiece, the squad could not outlast the Hawks’ offense. Hartford’s Amber Bepko scored 18 points and had eight rebounds as Deanna Mayza put up 13 points and seven assists.

Like the first Binghamton game, points scored from the paint played a big role in this game. Hartford outscored Stony Brook 32-18 in the paint. If the Seawolves hope to have a better game this time around, they need to have success in the paint. Another focus will be rebounding. SBU barely edged the Hawks in this category, with 35 rebounds to Hartford’s 34. If the Seawolves can grab more rebounds they will be able to control the flow of the game.

With a win in either game, the Seawolves will secure the third seed in the America East Conference.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_36055" align="alignleft" width="400"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-36055" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ENTER_MUS-GRAMMYS_118_LA-400x600.jpg" alt="LOS ANGELES TIMES / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE" width="400" height="600" /> Big Sean (left) arrives with Ariana Grande at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. <em>LOS ANGELES TIMES / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE</em>[/caption]

Big Sean has evolved. He is no longer  the butt-obsessed, young artist yelling ad-libs or leaning on featured artists to get record sales. Instead, his third album "Dark Sky Paradise," released on Feb. 24, shows a rapper willing to dive into his thoughts and give meaningful content.

The album does not start in the usual Big Sean manner, or a fast-paced staccato flow and lyrics that are braggadocio. Instead, we have a young, hungry Big Sean in "Dark Sky (Skyscrapers)".  This song demonstrates how he wants to become part of the discussion when it comes to who is the best rapper.  He wants the most money, he wants success.

This theme continues into the single "Blessings," featuring Drake.  After "Blessings," Big Sean moves on to his girl problems.  After breaking off his engagement to Naya Rivera, Big Sean decided to throw shots.  The Kanye West-assisted track "All Your Fault," as well as standout single "IDFWU," are proof.  Unfortunately, Big Sean reverts to his same old self in the latter half of the album.

The mispronunciation-for-the-sake-of-flow rapper is back in "Stay Down." While it is only a song, the reemergence of the "Finally Famous" Big Sean is never a good thing.  Also, one of his biggest faults is his flow never really changes up. It goes back and forth between his usual breakneck speed and a sing-song flow. He does, however, pick great production to help hide his weaknesses. The tracks seem to be effortless to rap on, yet they still display complexity.

Big Sean's production comes from the hit-makers of 2014. That list includes DJ Mustard, Mike Will Made It and G.O.O.D. Music boss West. G.O.O.D. Music label mate Travi$ Scott also has a production credit in conjunction with the young, up-and-coming Wondagurl.  The signature horns and beat switch-ups by Mike Will Made It make Big Sean's tornado flow seem almost natural. And what album would be complete without the sound of DJ Mustard's bass synth and snare? West's production does not show up until the outro of the album, where his sped up samples make a beautiful comeback. Producer Key Wane also had three production credits.

"Dark Sky Paradise" is the next step in Big Sean's path to greatness.  No longer is he asking Nicki Minaj to feature on an over-sexualized song in order to get plays. Now, he is calling out his ex-fiancé and even featuring his current girlfriend in the deluxe edition. His yearning for greatness makes the opening tracks great. While the middle tracks are forgettable, he ends the album on a high note with production from West.

This albums is not album of the year, not even close, but it is a great one for Big Sean. If you are already a fan, this album is definitely worth buying. If not, take a listen and respect the fact that G.O.O.D. Music's little brother can finally hold his own against legends like E-40 and West.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>SBU Food Show was a hit among Seawolves</title>

The event featured 25 vendors and a wide variety of dishes, including Bibimbap, as shown above.<em> PHOTO CREDIT : AGNES LY</em>[/caption]

Campus Dining held its annual Food Show Tuesday afternoon and it proved to be a huge success among students.

“As long as I get free food, it’s awesome,” Daud Khan, a sophomore astronomy major, said. He and many other students were amazed at what the 25 vendors located in the Student Activities Center Ballroom had to offer.

Companies either chose to showcase foods they already sell on campus or used the Food Show as an opportunity to try new ideas. All of the vendors displayed during the Food Show “are in some variety, sold on campus,” Marketing Manager of Campus Dining Services Carly Shephard said.

Shephard also said the event was a great way to “bring more awareness to the fact that we do have healthy items on campus.” Green Street, which is sold at the Student Union Commons on Mondays, chose to showcase quinoa bowls with a variety of vegetables.

Healthy beverages were also a trend at the show. Companies like Naked Juice, Tropicana, Honest Tea and Ito En were a big hit with the people who attended the event. Fresh apples, oranges and bananas were also available from J. Kings for students to try.

Students were offered Bibimbap, a traditional Korean rice based food with vegetables and meat; Kimbab, sushi filled with either spicy squid, ham or beef, scallops with lima beans, corn and cilantro; and health-conscious cookies from Hampton Creek.

“I think that this event is helpful to see what food is offered on campus, especially because I commute,” Erika Zevallos, a senior psychology major said.

Other students said the event introduced them to foods they did not know Stony Brook offered. The locations of where certain foods sold on campus were posted alongside the respective samples at the event.

The show was also extremely beneficial from the vendor’s point of view.

“You get to see what students like,” a representative from Lays said.

It was a great way for vendors to try out new ideas and see how they would be perceived by the student body. For West Side Dining, the event proved to be very successful. They gave away approximately 4500 sliders, a food they want to bring to campus for March Madness.

“I work for you, I’m your chef, so if you want sliders for March Madness, it’s up to you. The only way it happens is if there’s a lot of voices asking for it,” Andrew Greene, production chef at Campus Dining Services, said.

Many of the vendors became so popular, they were running out of supplies. Hershey’s Ice Cream ran out of its own cups and had extra employee’s scooping ice cream and frozen yogurt. Boar’s Head had the longest line at the show from start to finish and Hampton Coffee gave away hundreds of cups of coffee.

The Food Show took off this year, mostly because of the social media build up. “The notoriety is growing,” Shephard said before the show even started “there was a line out the door.”

The Show was publicized earlier in the week on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. Students also received hints on social media about what they could win at the event.

Seawolves were encouraged to enter a raffle by posting a picture on social media using the hashtag #sbueatsfoodshow. The winners of the prizes, which included a book bag, a flat-screen TV and a bike, were announced Tuesday night via social media.

Overall, students seemed to enjoy Tuesday’s event.

“I think it’s one of the best events Stony Brook has done,” Erica Ferer, a sophomore biomedical engineering major, said. “Free food is good, especially when it’s good free food.”

Students left the event smiling with food samples in hand. One student, as he walked out with his food, said “this is the greatest thing ever.”]]></content:encoded>

Gays finally have something to celebrate: as of this article (yes, it is changing that quickly), 37 U.S. states and the District of Columbia now grant same-sex marriage licenses. Just one year ago, that number was less than half of what it is today. Images of gay and lesbian couples exchanging vows are a frequent sight in the media. We have become a much more progressive nation over the past decade.

We can finally declare ourselves a society of equality, right?

Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. While we have made tremendous progress towards marriage-equality in the United States, 26 of the 37 states that have legalized same-sex marriage have done so through federal and state court decisions, and in most cases, it was the result of a homosexual couple suing the state for recognition of their union. Nine of the remaining states legalized same-sex marriage through state legislation, and only two states were granted marriage equality through referendums up for vote by the public. 71 percent of the population now lives in a state where same-sex marriage is legal, but according to the latest Gallup poll performed in May 2014, only 55 percent of the U.S. population supports same-sex marriage.

Now picture this: we are rapidly approaching the 100th anniversary of women’s suffrage. Gender equality and equal pay for women in the workplace is still a topic of conversation and debate today. Race relations, immigration reform and civil rights for minorities have become hot-button issues this year. If we are still discussing black and women’s rights in 2015, what will gay rights look like in 50 or 100 years?

Progress, by its very nature, tends to march forwards, and for a country that only 12 years ago ruled sodomy laws (the de facto ban on homosexuality) unconstitutional in the 17 states that still enforced them, the future does look bright. But we as a society are not done yet.
30 states do not protect discrimination regarding sexual orientation and gender identity in hiring practices. 39 do not protect against housing discrimination. Homosexual men are still banned by the FDA from blood and tissue donation. Replace the word "gay" with "black" or "Hispanic" in any of these scenarios and the United States would seem like the most backwards and discriminatory developed country in the world.

That is the current situation.

It is easy and willfully optimistic to assert that we are entering a chapter in society where discrimination based on sexuality is coming to a close. But we should not be blinded to the struggle that still remains. We should embrace the momentum of these great strides forward and pray that we continue towards the resolution of the good fight and hope that one day, we can truly say that within the United States, there exists equality for all.]]></content:encoded>

As churches lose more and more of their congregations as the younger people are not willing to live by 2000 year old laws and not willing to discriminate based on those laws, the change will be coming.  The Catholic church is the most fearful as they are losing members faster than any other group.  In that they are more strict, as least to the members, more and more people are not willing to follow their rules. Read up on how many Catholic churches were recently closed in NYC.  We know their population has not gone down.   More and more people are seeing the bigotry and persecution being spewed from the pulpits as opposed to the Love Thy Neighbor that is depicted in the Bible.  We will get there but it won't be a fast or easy road.]]></wp:comment_content>

Last Saturday, the Oscars fell upon us once again. To be completely honest, I did not even know the Oscars were happening. Yes, you can make fun of the fact that I live under a rock but at least it is cordial and cozy under there. Through make no mistake, I was made well aware that the Oscars were going down the second I opened Twitter and was bombarded with a timeline of Jimmy Choo shoes and Prada clutches. Much to my content, the greatest observation I made from the continuous stream of live tweets pouring in was the overwhelming presence of the hashtag, “#askhermore.”

The #askhermore hashtag was a movement started last year to get red carpet reporters to ask women more intelligent questions rather than just trivial questions such as what is she wearing. The idea for the hashtag movement was started last year by the Representation Project, an organization that is trying to use films and the movie industry as a catalyst for overcoming limiting stereotypes in the media. If it was up to me, I would give them all the Oscars for starting this movement.

Watching the red carpet is like pre-gaming for the party: you do not necessarily have to do it, but you will feel like you are doing it wrong if you miss it. That being said, a lot of people tune in to watch their favorite nominees walk down this colorful rug. E!’s "Live from the Red Carpet" show gathered 3.1 million viewers this year alone.

And do you know what the hot, thought provoking question of the day was? “What are you wearing? We are all just dying to know!”

Seriously? You are given a starting platform of at least 3 million viewers and this is the direction we go in? We should be using this opportunity to discuss social issues and concerns with these celebrities, not what shoes they decided to wear to the nominations.

There is no denying that fashion is naturally a part of the red carpet, and it rightfully should be. I know for a fact that if I am walking around in high heels and tight dress, I will feel confident and radiant and that is something reporters should touch upon. Discussing what one is wearing is perfectly fine and entertaining to watch, but only to an extent; when somewhere along the way you make a woman feel like she is a walking, talking mannequin, that is when we have gone too far.

On the flip side, while men do receive questions about fashion and health like women do, it is not in the same objectifying manner. Also, showing this comparison of men as the source of intelligence and women as eye-candy so continuously creates a terrible mentality that even though these actresses are working with the same people on the same movie as other actors, they are still inferior. Instead of being asked a mentally stimulating question, women are instead asked to discuss their fashion, health, personal lives, etc.

I think that Hadley Freeman, a New York fashion columnist and writer, epitomized this whole phenomena perfectly: “This is a strange pocket of the western world where it is still deemed utterly acceptable to take smart, successful women and reduce them to beauty pageant contestants…”

Like all things in Hollywood, #askhermore was a bit blown up and dramatized, but perhaps that is a good thing. The fight for gender equality should not be done quietly. #askhermore knocks down the stereotype that women are associated with having beauty, a butt and no brains in a way that girls everywhere can see the fight unfold and take part in as well.

Who knows, if this mentality somehow sticks among the crazy artificial nature of Hollywood, I just might remember what day the Oscars are next year.]]></content:encoded>

In an effort to get other student clubs and organizations involved, the team challenged three other sports clubs to also participate in the training.</p>
The Red Watch Band program has been running for five years at Stony Brook University. As part of a new push to have more students participate in the training, the organization introduced the Red Watch Band Care Team. The team is coming up with new ways to engage students to be part of the Red Watch Band community and aims to raise awareness of alcohol overdose and alcohol-related issues.

(PHOTO CREDIT : GOVERNOR'S PRESS OFFICE)[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In his latest effort to combat and prevent sexual assault on college campuses in New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced the new “Enough is Enough” campaign on Thursday, Feb. 25 “to push for the passage of the Governor’s legislation combating sexual assault on college campuses,” according to a press release.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We must do more to address sexual assault and rape on college campuses, and this law will ensure that students at all colleges in the State are protected by the same uniform policies that SUNY adopted last year,” Cuomo said. “New York must take a stand to combat the culture of sexual violence in higher education. New York should be a leader in the fight against sexual violence on college campuses.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to the Governor’s office, the effort is aimed at bringing the state’s attention to the pending legislation, which would demand all public and private colleges and universities in New York to adopt an identical definition of consent; a policy to protect victims of a sexual abuse crime from being punished for a student code of conduct violation like underage alcohol consumption or drug use; and the Sexual Assault Victims’ Bill of Rights, which would provide victims with his or her rights, a list of resources and steps for reporting the incident. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If a school does not comply with the policy after it is passed and codified in the state legislature, the school could risk losing the funding it receives from the state.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Managing the work of 64 campuses to get this right and implement a consistent and uniform policy is really coming to fruition,” SUNY Chancellor Nancy Zimpher said at a cabinet meeting on Feb. 25 in Albany. “This will be an ongoing effort, lessons that must be enforced and most importantly requires a change in campus culture which is hard to measure but we know is absolutely necessary and of course we know that doesn’t happen overnight.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The ‘Enough is Enough’ slogan was generated because it seemed like an obvious tag to go with the campaign and would show that in New York, enough is enough when it comes to sexual assaults on our college campuses,” a spokeswoman from the Governor’s office said
in an email.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To further promote the new effort, Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul will visit colleges and universities around the state and meet with students, faculty, administration, service providers and advocates for survivors of rape and sexual assault, according to a press release.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In conjunction with the “Enough is Enough” campaign, New York State Police Superintendent Joseph D’Amico also announced a new hotline specifically dedicated to reporting sexual assault cases on college and university campuses.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The hotline is run directly by the State Police, which will have dedicated members on-call 24/7 to answer and respond to calls,” the Governor’s spokeswoman said. “If a sex assault incident is reported to the State Police, state troopers will be responsible for handling and investigating it.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stony Brook University Chief of Police and Assistant Vice President for Campus Safety Robert J. Lenahan said that although University Police has not received any “additional guidance” from SUNY in regards to the “Enough is Enough” campaign, he said New York State Police is still working on developing the protocols and training courses mentioned.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I would say that as a general rule, additional methods for individuals to report they were a victim of sexual violence would be beneficial,” Lenahan said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The new campaign comes out as Stony Brook University faces a lawsuit filed by an alumna on Jan. 23, 2015 for “deliberate indifference,” in reference to the manner in which the university allegedly handled her sexual assault case. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On July 23, 2014, the United States Department of Education Office of Civil Rights opened an investigation into Stony Brook to look into possible violations of Title IX, a federal clause prohibiting discrimination based on sex at any federally-funded educational institution. The department ended its investigation of Binghamton University after announcing the investigation in May.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On Friday, Feb. 26, 2015 Vice President of Student Affairs Peter Baigent wrote an op-ed in The Journal News titled “In reply: Stony Brook respects Title IX,” in which he described the hearing procedures in sexual assault cases. Baigent also said the university is unable to comment on the ongoing lawsuit as it would violate federal privacy laws that prohibit disclosure of student information.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“In accordance with federal policy related to Title IX cases, Stony Brook’s process enables complainants to determine the level to which they participate in the hearing,” Baigent said. “They may choose to confront their alleged assailant (although neither party may directly question the other) or have a university representative present the case on their behalf. It is the complainants’ choice to participate as much in the proceeding as they feel comfortable. Regardless of their initial choice they can change their mind at any time.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to the Judicial Process Flow Chart on the University Office of Community Standards website, “The respondent(s), then the presiding University Official or hearing board members, may question the complainant regarding the opening statement and evidence.” It also says “The complainant(s) then the presiding University Official or hearing board members may question the opening statement.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When asked for clarification on the matter, Director of Title IX and Risk Management Marjolie Leonard and Director of Office of University Community Standards Matty Orlich were not available for comment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Governor’s office said that at this time, there are no plans to revise campus judiciary proceedings and protocols.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_36161" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-36161 size-medium" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/150226_USG-Senate_Manju.Shivacharan_9612-600x400.jpg" alt="MANJU SHIVACHARAN / THE STATESMAN" width="600" height="400" /> Vice President of Veteran Students Organization (VSO) Dan Pilo, left, said, VSO wants to hold events to open up a discussion between the campus community and its veterans. (MANJU SHIVACHARAN / THE STATESMAN)[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A motion to move the Stony Brook University men’s club lacrosse team to line budget status failed by a vote of 11-8-0 during the Undergraduate Student Government senate meeting on Thursday, Feb. 26.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because the club was on line-budget status last year and was removed, its members asked to be reinstated from Special Services Council (SSC) budget status at the second-to-last SSC Committee meeting, according to Treasurer Kathryn Michaud. When the committee denied this, the team brought the issue to the senate on Thursday. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Several concerns regarding the club were brought to the senate’s attention, including outstanding balances which were due last spring. Additionally, the team only spent $150 of its $799.98 budget and failed to host an on-campus event in the fall semester,. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Veteran Students Organization (VSO), the Stony Brook chapter of Student Veterans of America, asked for a $555 budget for when they host Veterans Awareness Week in the middle of April. Over the course of four days, the club would host a movie night, a veteran panel, a charity drive and a social. Vice President Dan Pilo said all of the events would be geared towards bringing together the campus community with its veterans.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“In case you haven’t noticed, we’re all fairly older than you guys. We have a different perspective on things,” Pilo said to the senate. “By having those conversations and seeing those different points of view, we can open up a much bigger dialogue.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to Senator Taylor Bouraad, VSO originally asked for a budget of $800, but the SSC Committee had cut it down to $555 at the committee meeting on Monday. Bouraad said that while the money the club was asking for was mainly for food, the committee made cuts in order to accommodate other SSC clubs during the semester. VSO had also asked for part of the $800 to be spent on awards. However, as per the SSC bylaws, SSC-funded clubs cannot be granted money for awards.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The motion to approve VSO’s budget passed by a vote of 19-0-0.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The senate also passed the Appropriations Act 3, which would allow for the transfer of unspent money from Special Services Council-funded clubs to be put back into the SSC budget to be given out to other clubs during the semester.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In President Garry Lachhar’s absence, Executive Vice President James Alrassi stepped down to present the SUNY Assembly Spring Conference roster to the senate. The conference, which takes place once a semester, will be hosted in Binghamton from April 10 to 12.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Alrassi said that 16 members of USG, including Executive Council members, senators and agency members, had sent in nominations to attend. Of the 14 who were selected, only seven will be able to attend the workshops during the conference. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Alrassi explained that Vice President of Academic Affairs Steven Adelson and Director of Events Management Tyrik Jiang’s nominations were not accepted due to prior circumstances.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When Lachhar arrived later, he said he would still accept nominations. The senate voted to table the vote so that those who were not approved or had not submitted a nomination yet could present their cases to the senate at
a later date.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The senate tabled the votes on the Club Table Tennis’ SSC budget and the Pre-Occupational Therapy Club’s SSC budget because representatives from both clubs did not attend the meeting.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

In 1998, Chernow took on her first position in higher education by becoming Stony Brook’s Assistant Vice President for Entrepreneurial Programs. Under this title, she worked on fundraising galas and developed summer camps for local kids and teenagers, both academic and recreational, to give students an opportunity to acclimate to college. These camps not only give local youth a summer activity, but also employ students from  the university.  Before becoming Senior Vice President for Administration, she worked as Assistant Vice President for Facilities and Services in 2003. She was promoted to Vice president for Facilities, Services, and Special Initiatives in 2006. From 2007 to 2013, she was president of the Faculty Student Association.  After being appointed to the position of Senior Vice President for Administration in 2012, President Samuel L. Stanley Jr. appointed Chernow to be the brain behind “Project 50 Forward,” an initiative that works to improve all facets of the university, and consists of three separate branches: operational excellence, building for the future, and  academic greatness.  “I am grateful for her assiduous efforts toward making Stony Brook University the outstanding facility it is, and helping us to move forward in many important areas,” Stanley said in a statement to the Stony Brook faculty  and staff. Chernow works with focus groups made up of students, faculty, and staff to help drive Project 50 Forward into the next  few decades. “Figuring out the best way to do it—not for them, with them—and that’s the fun part, working with students, faculty, and staff,” Chernow said about enhancing the school. She also said that without the voices of the students and faculty, it would not be possible to foster  a united university. One of the accomplishments that Chernow said she is most satisfied with is the decrease in crime on campus. Compared to 2007, the crime rate has gone down by 87 percent. “We have a reduction in crime while promoting a culture of reporting, encouraging students for counseling issues or whatever’s bothering them, and to report,” Chernow said.  Working with the Faculty Student Association, she made changes to the dining experience to give students what they desired. When students craved more diverse food, her team introduced Jasmine in the Charles B. Wang Center. When students sought faster options, they had food trucks come to campus.   Chernow also worked to lower the university’s impact on the environment. In 2006, the university saved more than $34 million by tweaking things like light sensors and thermostat regulations, according to Stanley’s statement. With 500,000 square feet added to the campus in the last four years, energy consumption has actually decreased. Chernow also oversaw the expansion of the energy-saving initiatives such as Wolf Ride Bike Share, biodiesel-fueled buses, vehicle-charging stations and solar powered parking meters—just a few ways in which the university  decreases pollution.  Even as Chernow packs up, her papers will be contributed to the “RecycleMania” effort on campus, as indicated by the massive recycling bin in her office. The university won the national competition for recycling the most e-waste in both 2013 and 2014.  Stony Brook recently made the Princeton Review’s Green Honor Roll, putting the university among the ranks of Harvard, Stanford, Cornell and Columbia. SBU was one of 24 schools that achieved a perfect score out of the 861 schools total. Additionally, Stony Brook received Tree Campus USA recognition  in 2014. Building for the future is executed through the Facilities Master Plan. Chernow oversaw the development of an extensive list of facilities, such as the Island Federal Credit Union Arena, the Simons Center, Joe Nathan Field, the Dubin Family Center, the Walter J. Hawrys Campus Recreation Center, West Side Dining, Nobel Halls, Frey Hall  and West Apartments.  In 2013, Chernow also pledged $25,000 to introduce the Carol Chernow Memorial Scholarship for journalism students on behalf of her mother, an advocate for improved language  and writing skills.   Chernow has a passion for working with other people and will miss the people she had the pleasure of working with.  “I feel incredibly fortunate. I’ve had a great run here and it’s really because of the great staff and I’m really proud of them,” Chernow said.

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even as Chernow packs up, her papers will be contributed to the “RecycleMania” effort on campus, as indicated by the massive recycling bin in her office. The university won the national competition for recycling the most e-waste in both 2013 and 2014. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stony Brook recently made the Princeton Review’s Green Honor Roll, putting the university among the ranks of Harvard, Stanford, Cornell and Columbia. SBU was one of 24 schools that achieved a perfect score out of the 861 schools total. Additionally, Stony Brook received Tree Campus USA recognition in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Building for the future is executed through the Facilities Master Plan. Chernow oversaw the development of an extensive list of facilities, such as the Island Federal Credit Union Arena, the Simons Center, Joe Nathan Field, the Dubin Family Center, the Walter J. Hawrys Campus Recreation Center, West Side Dining, Nobel Halls, Frey Hall and West Apartments. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2013, Chernow also pledged $25,000 to introduce the Carol Chernow Memorial Scholarship for journalism students on behalf of her mother, an advocate for improved language
and writing skills. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Chernow has a passion for working with other people and will miss the people she had the pleasure of working with. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I feel incredibly fortunate. I’ve had a great run here and it’s really because of the great staff and I’m really proud of them,” Chernow said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1">Stony Brook graduates are making an impact in the New York State Assembly.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The recently-elected speaker of the Assembly, Carl Heastie, is a Stony Brook alum, along with three other Assembly members: Steve Englebright, Kimberly Jean-Pierre and Latoya Joyner.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><span class="s2"><b><i>Carl Heastie</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Heastie became speaker of the Assembly after former Speaker Sheldon Silver was arrested on federal corruption charges.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A former budget analyst for the New York City Comptroller’s Office, Heastie is New York’s first African-American Assembly speaker.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At Stony Brook, Heastie earned a Bachelor of Science in applied mathematics and statistics in 1990. He later earned a Master's of Business Administration in finance from the Bernard M. Baruch College in 2007.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2000, Heastie was first elected into the Assembly to represent the 83rd District of New York. He is a member of the Democratic Party.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">His legislative record includes nine bills in three years, including actions to raise penalties for wage theft, increase minimum wage and the addition of light green taxis for the outer boroughs of New York.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">“I’m so very pleased that Carl Heastie is the new speaker,” Englebright said.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><span class="s2"><b><i>Steve Englebright</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">In 1974, Englebright received a Master of Science degree in paleontology/sedimentology from Stony Brook that helped his career in the Assembly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“What we do everyday at the Assembly is try to solve problems, and that’s what we did everyday at the State University of New York at Stony Brook,” Englebright said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Englebright is a member of the Democratic Party and represents the 4th Assembly District.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Towards beginning of his career, Englebright was elected into the Suffolk County Legislature in 1983 and the New York State Assembly in 1992.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In February, following the election of Heastie, Englebright was appointed chairman of the Environmental Conservation Committee.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the 90s, Englebright authored New York’s laws on solar and wind net-metering, a system where excess power from renewable energy generators is transferred onto the grid and the owners are compensated. In 2008, he pressed for the expansion of solar net-metering to include all utility customer classes.</span></p>
<p class="p1">“I’ve wrote and passed a number of laws that set the stage for the solar energy and wind energy, the renewable energy revolution that the state is now going through,” Englebright said.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the future, Englebright hopes to address more environmental issues.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I’m honored that Carl Heastie has appointed me to chair of the environmental conservation committee, and that committee will be a forum for taking on some of the major environmental challenges that we have at this time including a climate change strategy to deal will climate change is effecting our state,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><span class="s2"><b><i>Kimberly Jean-Pierre</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Assemblywoman Kimberly Jean-Pierre was also excited for Heastie’s latest accomplishment. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“It was not only an important time in the Assembly but also a historic moment in New York State’s history as we elected the first black speaker which was truly remarkable,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jean-Pierre earned her Master’s of Science in public policy from Stony Brook in 2007.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She has represented the 11th Assembly District since 2014, and she is a member of the Democratic Party.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“With just two months in office, I have met with various groups on education to issues concerning quality of life,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before Jean-Pierre was elected into the New York State Assembly, she was a legislative aid for DuWayne Gregory of the Suffolk County Legislature. After two years working as an aid, she moved on to being a community outreach coordinator for U.S. Rep. Steve Israel. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2013, Jean-Pierre became vice president of properties at the Town of Babylon’s Industrial Development Agency (IDA). With the IDA, Jean-Pierre worked alongside the Babylon community to coordinate resources for residents.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I never thought of running,” Jean-Pierre said. “I enjoy being the hands-on employee but also understand that we need leadership that understands the concerns and the needs of the district.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jean-Pierre currently sits on the Economic Development Committee, Mental Health Committee, Local Government Committee, Transportation Committee and Banks Committee. She is also part of the Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian Legislative Caucus.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><span class="s2"><b><i>Latoya Joyner</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Assemblywoman Latoya Joyner graduated from Stony Brook with honors and a bachelor’s degree in political science and sociology. She also participated in Stony Brook’s Educational Opportunity Program.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Joyner is a member of the Democratic Party and represents the 77th Assembly District. She was first elected into office in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Joyner interned with the office of then-state Assemblywoman Aurelia Greene and was eventually promoted to community liaison in
Greene’s district office.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After Joyner’s internship she went on to attend the University of Buffalo Law School. Joyner interned with the New York State Division of Human Rights in the Bronx during her time at Buffalo.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Prior to being elected into the Assembly, Joyner served as a court attorney for a New York City Civil Court judge.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Joyner currently serves on the Aging, Consumer Affairs and Protection, Housing, Insurance and Social Services Committees.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most recently Joyner introduced legislation that will work to end income-based tenant discrimination in New York.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_36194" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-36194 size-medium" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/mensbball_umasslowell_25-600x424.jpg" alt="HEATHER KHALIFA / THE STATESMAN" width="600" height="424" /> Jameel Warney has been essential to the Stony Brook offense with his constant rebounding. <em>HEATHER KHALIFA / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

Stony Brook men’s basketball is heading to the America East Tournament with all the momentum the Seawolves could have hoped for after topping UMass-Lowell 75-60 and Hartford 74-59 to make it six-straight wins for SBU.

“20 wins. That’s tough to do,” Head Coach Steve Pikiell said following the UMass-Lowell victory. “I’m proud of these guys. Took care of business.”

On Wednesday night, the Seawolves stumbled out of the gates in their final regular-season home game against the River Hawks, falling behind 11-4 early. UMass-Lowell punished Stony Brook from deep, hitting three threes within the first five minutes. The River Hawks lead would be short-lived though, as SBU quickly responded with a 21-5 run.

The Seawolves collected 50 percent of available offensive rebounds and 56 percent of available defensive boards in the first half, which are astronomical rates.

“We have two of the best rebounders in our conference,” Jameel Warney said. “We like to rebound the ball. That’s a great way for second offense when our shots aren’t falling.”

The Seawolves’ bigs would lock in on the stretched-out frontcourt of the River Hawks and hold UMass-Lowell to just five made field goals for the rest of the period following the strong start.

Offensively, Stony Brook once again found a hot hand in freshman Roland Nyama. Coming off a 22-point night against Binghamton, Nyama scored 10 points in the first half.

“Roland’s getting better and better,” Pikiell said. “When you watch the tapes, you really notice some of the things he does. He’s just getting more comfortable, he has a lot of fun out there on the court and I like that. He’s got a little swagger about him.”

Adding to Nyama’s contribution was not just Warney’s usual dominance, but another standout performance from junior Scott King. He came off the bench firing, scoring nine points in the first half, including a four-point play.

“To Scott’s credit we called his name and he’s been ready to go,” Pikiell said. “We’re playing him at different positions too. He wasn’t really a three man, we’re kind of forcing the three spot on him a little bit. He’s really picked it up quickly in practice.”

The second half was more of the same for Stony Brook. UMass-Lowell attempted to play some zone in spots but in doing so allowed Nyama and King to knock down more threes. Eventually the River Hawks tightened their grip on the shooters, which was when Warney went to work.

“We had a nice size advantage against them,” Warney, who finished with 23 points and 12 rebounds, said. “My teammates did a great job looking for me and feeding me in spots that I can score in.”

Nyama finished with 16 points on four threes. King added 12 and Rayshaun McGrew had a double-double with 10 points and 10 rebounds in the victory.

The Seawolves then traveled to Hartford for their final game of the regular season and continued the onslaught they
delivered UMass-Lowell.

From the 17:37 mark to 7:51 remaining in the first half, Stony Brook did not allow the Hawks to connect on a field goal. Hartford was without leading scorer Mark Nwakamma, who exited the game three seconds into Senior Night to rest up for the postseason. This allowed Warney to have a field day on both ends.

The end tally for Warney was 32 points, 18 rebounds and three blocks on 13-17 shooting from the field.

While the Hawks collapsed on any high-low attempt aimed at Warney in their last meeting with SBU, they did not show nearly the same pressure on Saturday night. Nyama and King’s recent shooting exploits, along with Nwakamma not playing, likely caused this scheme change, allowing Warney to play his best game of the season.

The Seawolves seized control minutes into the game with a 24-6 run and held onto it throughout. Aiding Warney in his supremacy was fellow junior Carson Puriefoy, who had his second 20-point and second 50-percent shooting game in a month’s time. Puriefoy finished with 22 points and three threes on 7-14 shooting from the field.

This contest was an impressive team effort when surveying the defensive end. The Hawks got few good looks and were relegated to 33.3 percent shooting on the night, including 5-of-24 shooting from downtown, where they normally excel. Stony Brook would coast to a 74-59 win, finishing the season with a 21-10 record, its fourth straight 20-win season and its fifth in six years.

The Seawolves will host Binghamton in their America East Tournament quarterfinal matchup of the on Wednesday, March 4.

“We just have to keep on playing. Have to go into the playoffs with good momentum,” Warney said. “We can’t limp into the playoffs and we can’t take our first round game lightly because if we lose that then our season’s over with.”

[caption id="attachment_36375" align="alignleft" width="600"]<a href="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/hanaa.tameez_sabreproctor_wbb.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-36375" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/hanaa.tameez_sabreproctor_wbb-600x400.jpg" alt="Sabre Proctor keeps up on both the offensive and defensive sides of the pain.

After sliding past Albany, the Stony Brook Seawolves locked up the third seed in the America East tournament, defeating Binghamton 68-59 on Thursday night in Vestal, N.Y.

The first half was a rough one to start. After going scoreless in the first five minutes and allowing a six-point run by the Bearcats, the Seawolves finally got their offense started with a layup by sophomore guard Christa Scognamiglio.

The Seawolves kept up the tempo by going on a 12-3 run led by sophomore guard Kori Bayne-Walker and senior forward Sabre Proctor.  They were held in check as Binghamton’s freshman guard Jasmine Sina got off the bench and helped jumpstart the Bearcats’ offense.

Stony Brook managed to hold on to the lead for the rest of half ending taking a 30-28 lead into the break.

A minute into the second half, it looked like it was going to be more of the same.  The Seawolves started 0-3 from the field and had two turnovers in the first three minutes. But, looks can be deceiving. Bayne-Walker came to play in the second, scoring 15 of her 23 on the night.

The Seawolves went on a 19-3 run, making the game 49-33 with 11 minutes remaining. After that, it was just smooth sailing for Stony Brook.

Whatever the Bearcats tried, Stony Brook had an answer for it.  The game ended with Scognamiglio dribbling the ball out after collecting her fourth steal, giving the Seawolves a 68-59 win.

Just like she has been for most of the season, Bayne-Walker was the story of the game.  Her game-high 23 points fueled the Seawolves all game long. She also dished the ball off well, tallying four assists. Proctor also had a great game with 16 points and six defensive boards.

Women’s basketball team had nothing to play for but confidence on Sunday afternoon against the Hartford Hawks, being already locked into a Saturday night clash in the America East Championships against UMBC at 8:30 p.m.

However, in spite of a 56-49 loss to the same team that broke the hearts of Seawolves fans at Island Federal Credit Union Arena in a 60-58 loss on Jan. 29, Stony Brook has reason for optimism heading into the America East quarterfinals.

Stony Brook’s two leading scorers during conference play heading into the game against the Hawks contest were senior Proctor and junior Brittany Snow, who had accounted for an average of 25.5 points per game. Against Hartford, the duo went four for 21 from the field, for 12 points in the loss.

It was the worst performance for the duo in conference play, the next  lowest point total being 14, again against Hartford. Yet, the Seawolves hung tough in a tough opponent’s gym, pushing the game until the waning moments, when free throws by the Hawks sealed the deal.

One may wonder why the struggle of two of Stony Brook’s best players in the last game of the regular season provides reason for optimism, but it is simple. Hartford is the only team that the Seawolves’ forwards have mightily struggled against this season, and it is highly unlikely that they will see the Hawks again.

There is no reason to expect the duo to falter again, especially if the Seawolves should eventually find themselves against Albany in the semifinals, which they played great basketball against in ending the Great Danes’ 30-game road America East winning streak.

In the loss, sophomores Bayne-Walker, Scognamiglio and senior Jessica Ogunnorin all reached double digits, as they totaled 12, 11 and 10 points, respectively.

Even though Proctor struggled from the field, she crashed the boards nonetheless, snatching 10 rebounds on the game.

The Seawolves would go on to win the matchup, 10-9. <em>CHRISTOPHER CAMERON / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

With the stinging memory of a heartbreaking fourth-quarter collapse to St. John’s in mind, the Stony Brook’s men’s lacrosse team was able to fend off a billowing Fairfield team and take a 10-9 home win.

“It was good to pull away against a real quality team in Fairfield. [Fairfield was a] twelve-win team last year, so it’s a really big win for us,” Head Coach Jim Nagle said. “The guys have been working really hard and it’s nice to see us come out. We’ve come out on the upsetting sides of those recently. It was good to get a big win in a close game like that.”

The Seawolves came out of the gates aggressively, with sophomore midfielder Jeff Reh scoring his first goal of the year in transition off of a turnover and junior attack Brody Eastwood burying a shot after key ball movement opened up Fairfield’s defense within the first three minutes of the game.

Mike Rooney dished an assist on both goals and finished the day with seven, surpassing a career-high of six assists in one game, which was set in game against Fairfield two years ago.

“I’m just getting it and passing it off to someone else for a shot,” Rooney said. “Everyone can finish on our offense and just moving the ball makes it easy.”

Stony Brook led 5-1 at the end of the first quarter, but the Stags were able to grind their way back into the game and continued to chip away at the lead.

After recovering six turnovers in the second and successfully winning 14 of 22 total faceoffs, Fairfield was able to put away five goals, three of which came unassisted by way of senior attack Colin McLinden, in the second and third periods.

This set up a 8-6 Stony Brook lead going into the fourth.

Stony Brook successfully held on to its lead throughout the whole game due, in large part to a zone defense that disallowed interior play and forced Fairfield to take many ill-advised shots.

After a timely fourth quarter save by freshman goalkeeper Brandon Maciejewski, who notched nine total saves, Stony Brook held possession until junior midfielder Chris Hughes scored his third goal of the game with a Rooney assist.

Fairfield soon responded with a goal of its own at the 8:30 mark, making the score 9-8 Stony Brook.

Sophomore midfielder Ryan Bitzer then iced it with his second goal of the season with 5:20 left.

Next up for Stony Brook is a matchup with 2-0 Marist on Tuesday night at 7 p.m. On Sunday they will stay on the road to face Rutgers.]]></content:encoded>

The first two months of the season for the Stony Brook women’s basketball team were anything but smooth. The team hit some early bumps in the road against strong out-of-conference opponents, while trying to adjust to playing under new Head Coach Caroline McCombs.

Once the new year rolled around, the team still struggled to find consistency as they started out 4-4 in conference play. During the month of January, the Seawolves suffered losses to New Hampshire, Albany, Maine and Hartford, teams that all finished in the top five in the conference this season.

The first 21 games of McCombs’ Stony Brook tenure were rather disappointing, given the high expectations the team had coming into the season. About halfway through their conference schedule, the Seawolves found themselves in the middle of the pack in the standings. This came just a year after SBU had made it to the America East Championship game.

In the month of February, things changed for Stony Brook. The Seawolves found the consistency that they had lacked for the first three quarters of the season, and showcased the potential many had seen in the team before the season began.

Stony Brook won six of its seven games in February, scoring 60 or more points in every one of its victories.

The most important of those six wins came on Feb. 22, when the Seawolves took down rival Albany at home. The victory helped SBU secure the No. 3 seed entering the conference tournament while also giving the team the confidence that it can beat top America East foes.

Stony Brook will begin its quest for the program’s first America East title on Saturday night, when the Seawolves take on the UMBC Retrievers in Vestal, N.Y.

While no conference tournament games should be taken lightly, the Retrievers do present the Seawolves with a winnable matchup in their quarterfinals matchup. UMBC had a 11-18 overall record in the regular season, and was only 6-10 in America East play.

Defense has been the biggest problem area for the Retrievers this season.

Their 66.9 points allowed per game was the fourth-highest average in the conference and was nearly ten points higher than Stony Brook’s.

UMBC’s poor perimeter defense is something the Seawolves will need to take advantage of on Saturday.

The Retrievers allowed opponents to shoot 33 percent from three-point range during the 2014-15 season.

Stony Brook took advantage of this in its most recent matchup with UMBC.

The Seawolves nailed eight three-pointers, in their 74-41 blowout win over the Retrievers, back on Feb. 11. Sabre Proctor and Christa Scognamiglio hit three each from beyond the arc in the contest.

One thing that has made UMBC dangerous at times this season is its ability to score the ball.

The Retrievers’ points-per-game average ranked third highest in the America East, one spot higher than the Seawolves.

But, the Stony Brook defense kept UMBC’s offense in check in their two matchups.

The Seawolves only allowed the Retrievers to shoot 37 percent from the field in their first meeting, than 34.6 percent from the floor in their second game.

SBU has done an excellent job in containing UMBC’s Capree Garner, who is the America East’s second leading scorer
this season.

The junior is averaging 16.9 points per game this season, but has scored just 17 combined points in two games against the Seawolves. She shot 8-of-33 from the field in those contests.

If Stony Brook gets past UMBC, a matchup with Albany will likely be waiting for the Seawolves in the semifinals.

Taking down Shereesha Richards and the rest of the Great Danes will not be an easy task for SBU.

However, defeating the three-time defending conference champions seems much more possible now than it did a month ago for the Seawolves.]]></content:encoded>

The Seawolves will now look to take home their first America East Championship. HEATHER KHALIFA / THE STATESMAN[/caption]

Here we are. The Stony Brook men’s basketball team is once again on the verge of taking on the America East for a shot at advancing to the NCAA Tournament. Will this season end in bitterness and shock like so many before it, or will the Seawolves finally go dancing in March?

It all comes down to an assortment of factors; basketball nuances that have appeared, disintegrated, evolved and regressed throughout the season.

They all come into play in the coming weeks, and here is how Stony Brook needs to take hold of these many facets and use them to achieve what they have long dreamed of achieving.

In all likelihood, following a win against Binghamton at home, Stony Brook will travel to Vermont for its second round matchup. If SBU wins there, it is on to Albany.

On the offensive end, the Seawolves ranked No. 234 in the nation according to Kenpom, a troubling number.

Jameel Warney has been nearly unstoppable and this team is much more willing and capable of shooting the three than last year’s. However, there are still major concerns.

The scoring can not strictly come from Warney. The Seawolves are 15-3 this season when three or more players score in double-digits.

Others have to step up, especially since it is hard to imagine teams will not double Warney with impunity in tournament play.

Who and how is the question, though. Carson Puriefoy has not been consistent all season, even closing the season with a month where he only shot above 50 percent in two games. Rayshaun McGrew mostly thrives on open jumpers and offensive rebounds when it was expected that he could bully his way in the post against conference opponents.

Then, there is freshman Roland Nyama, who has come on as a scorer late in the season, but has only scored a combined eight points in four games against Vermont and Albany.

Puriefoy and Nyama need to be aggressive in looking for their shots, especially inside looks. Both have a tendency to settle when lanes are not revealing themselves, but doing so usually does more harm than good. McGrew will have to knock down those baseline jumpers and take advantage of any mismatch he gets.

Bryan Sekunda and Kameron Mitchell will have to make their open threes, especially against zone defenses SBU will certainly face.

The ball has to keep moving, and under no circumstances can Warney have an off night. He is the team’s go-to guy and will be the first name on each team’s scouting report, but he must take that with perseverance and dominate as he has all season.

However, in the end, Stony Brook’s offense merely has to be solid with how good its defense has been this season.

The Seawolves ranks a remarkable No. 70 in the country in defensive efficiency according to Kenpom and have not allowed a team to score 70 points since mid-December. Simply put, if SBU is at its best defensively there is not much to worry about on this end.

Head Coach Steve Pikiell will likely not change up his schemes, but instead rely on his team communicating, and being a step faster and an inch higher off the ground.

Some individual matchups to be on the look out for are Puriefoy on Binghamton’s Marlon Beck, Warney on Vermont’s Ethan O’Day and McGrew on Albany’s Sam Rowley.

The only real concerns for the Seawolves would be keeping out of foul trouble and being able to defend teams that can spread the floor five positions deep like the Catamounts and Great Danes.

Rebounding the basketball has also been an area in which SBU has been superb, finishing in the top-20 in the country in both offensive and defensive rebounding rates.

Binghamton, Vermont and Albany will all put up a strong fight on the glass however, once again calling on SBU’s role players to help out the big names.

Whoever is playing the three spot must crash the boards, whether it be Nyama, King or anybody else.

Many of the wings on the roster can be a huge help in rebounding, but effort and wanting to leak out on offense have impeded their effectiveness.

This obviously has to be avoided. The last headline Seawolves fans want to read when the America East Tournament winds to a close is “Same Seawolves, Different Year,” but trying to circumvent that will be a daunting task for a roster absent seniors and so reliant on freshmen.

It is fair to say that Stony Brook’s youth would be a valid excuse for not going all the way this season, but it would not fend off the disappointment.

A safe bet would be to expect SBU to get knocked out of the second or final round, but they do not call it “March Madness” for no reason.]]></content:encoded>

It looked as if freshman Kylie Ohlmiller scored her first career goal in Stony Brook’s women’s lacrosse season-opener a week ago against USC. The referees thought otherwise, based on an illegal stick call.

She left no doubt when the Seawolves beat Drexel 8-4 on a sunny Saturday afternoon at Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium, putting her name in the goals column for the first time at 16:05 of the second half and kickstarting what Head Coach Joe Spallina has said will be a memorable career.

“Awesome.” That was what came to Ohlmiller’s mind first when thinking about getting to see one of her shots hit the back of the net for the very first time.

“I definitely missed that opportunity the first game,” Ohlmiller said. “It’s pretty cool now.”

She was cool in scoring the goal as well, taking a pass from fellow freshman Samantha DiSalvo off of a free-position attempt, faking the shot and than burying it. When many young student-athletes may be anxious to score their first, Ohlmiller was mature beyond her years.

“I try to not think about it, just leave it in the past, just move on and try to get the next one,” the West Islip, N.Y. native said.

Ohlmiller did more than just score for the first time in college, however, feeding DiSalvo and sophomore Courtney Murphy for goals of their own.

In fact, DiSalvo joined the first-timers party, as her shot just 3:05 into the contest earned her first career goal as well.

Murphy continued the trend that she has set throughout her young career by leading the team in goals. The Shirely, N.Y. native paced the team and freshmen throughout the country in scoring last season, led the Seawolves with two against USC, and notched three goals on Saturday.

Classmate Dorrien Van Dyke got in on the action as well, putting the game away in its waning moments by scoring her third of the season with 1:41 remaining.

Sophomore goaltender Kaitlyn Leahy kept the Seawolves ahead in the win, looking comfortable in her second career start. She made seven saves on the game, including fending off four of the five free-position shots that she faced. It did not hurt that the always-swarming Stony Brook defense not only forced 20 turnovers, 11 in the second half, but it was perfect on  their 17 clear attempts against the Dragons.

“We played great defense,” Spallina said, while not all too happy about his team committing 41 fouls on the game. “The thing that bothers me more is the 15 turnovers.”

After controlling play with dominant defense in the first half, the Seawolves played even ball with Drexel in the second.

“You can’t turn the ball over like that,” Spallina said about 10 second-half turnovers. “You’ve got to be able to score more efficiently.”

“Defensively, I think we’re showing signs of being a championship caliber defense,” Spallina said, more concerned with the other side of the ball. “Once we figure out the offensive side a little bit better, I think we’ll be a force to be reckoned with.”

Only two games in, Stony Brook has plenty of time to figure that out. The Seawolves face Villanova on Saturday.]]></content:encoded>

The Seawolves baseball team took its talents to Florida this weekend for a three-game series with the No. 2 team in the nation, the Florida Gators. The team could not come away with a win against the Gators in its final trip close to the Gulf of Mexico this season.

In game one, it was a good, old-fashioned pitchers duel as Seawolves starter Tim Knesnik threw toe-to-toe with the reigning SEC Freshman of the Year Logan Shore.

Despite drawing three walks, a career high for the sophomore, the Seawolves were only able to muster one hit in 6.1 innings that Shore was on the mound, not giving Knesnik the run support he deserved in a 1-0 Gators win.

The junior threw five-plus innings, allowing only the one run on five hits.

The lone run was scored by Florida in the bottom of the sixth, when JJ Schwarz drove a double down the left-field line, scoring Harrison Bader from first.

Bobby Poyner went 2.2 innings for the save, allowing a miniscule two hits.

Game two was a completely different story, as the bats came alive for one side at least. Johnny Caputo started the scoring with the third home run of his career, a three-run blast to give the Seawolves the early 3-0 lead.

After that, it was all Gators, as they scored 14 unanswered runs in a final that looked more like a football score than a baseball margin, finishing 14-3.

The Gators plated five runs in their half of the first to immediately take the lead, and then scored at least one in the third, fourth, fifth and sixth innings to keep their distance from Stony Brook.

Seawolves ace Tyler Honahan had his worst outing of the season by far, as he was chased from the mound after allowing four runs on six hits in just 2.2 innings.

The sweep was finished on Sunday afternoon, as Florida took the matinee matchup 6-2.

The Gators scored a pair of runs in the second inning and did not look back, adding tallies in the third, fifth, seventh and eighth innings.

Florida used two long balls in order to get on the board, and held on from there.

The Seawolves scored their runs in the eighth and ninth, but it was too little, too late. Jeremy Giles laced a double down the left-field line to put Stony Brook on the board. Then, Malcolm Nachmanoff got his second hit of the afternoon with a base knock to left, scoring Caputo from third.

Baseball will finally come to Joe Nathan Field on Tuesday, when Stony Brook plays NYIT.]]></content:encoded>

Coming off its third-consecutive ESCHL conference championship, the Stony Brook Seawolves men’s hockey team looks to reach their pinnacle—a National Championship.

A 30-5 regular season record earned the Seawolves the number five seed in the upcoming ACHA Tournament. This means they will get underway on Saturday, March 7, at 7 p.m. from Cleveland, Ohio, against the University of Rhode Island Rams.

With it being a single-elimination tournament, it will quickly come and go; there will be no time for slip-ups or do-overs.

“Coming off our Final Four run last year,” sophomore forward Bobby Guidal said, “we learned a lot of what it takes to ultimately win a National Championship.”

That sentiment was echoed by junior goaltender Brendan Jones, who added, “If we won, it would be the greatest damn feeling I’ve ever experienced and I know that for a fact.”

That is not to say that there is not the potential for some butterflies.

Guidal agrees, “Going into a huge tournament such as this is bound to bring out a whole bunch of emotions, but for the most part, I think we are a collected and confident group.”

Jones brings a different perspective to the table, “my mind never wanders and I’m locked in from start to finish.”

While the national tournament usually leads to opponents teams have never met, the Seawolves are actually quite familiar with their first-round opponent.

The Rams were one of three teams all season long to actually puncture the Seawolves’ record, beating them 5-1 in their first matchup of the year back on Oct. 3.

From that game on, Stony Brook would win the next three against the Rams by a combined final score of 11-4.

The last time the Seawolves actually lost a game goes all the way back to over a month ago against the consensus number one team in the nation, the Arizona State Sun Devils, on Jan. 22.

The two teams met on three separate occasions during the regular season, with ASU handing the Seawolves two of their losses.

A potential collision with the Sun Devils would come in the semi-finals on Monday, March 9.

It would be essential to get off to a quick start, as even in the game that Stony Brook took down the Sun Devils, they trailed from the get-go.

However, there will be a small chink in the armor, as Sun Devils netminder Robert Levin will miss the tournament with a torn ACL.

It was announced earlier this season that Arizona State would be transitioning to the Division-I level in the upcoming seasons.

This has invariably led to talks of the Seawolves and how they may fit into the same picture.

“If we were to bring the cup back to Stony Brook, I think the exposure and coverage that we would be getting would make it impossible for those talks to remain under wraps,” Jones said, “You can only keep something tied up for so long until it gets so big it breaks free.”

A new Division I team would be thrown into many discussions within the athletic department, as the expansion of Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium, which houses the football, soccer and lacrosse teams, seems inevitable.

After five months of fighting for respect from the rest of the country, the Seawolves have one last chance to seal the deal.]]></content:encoded>

Last Friday, Stony Book Softball traveled south for the North Florida Tournament. Entering the five-game weekend tournament, the Seawolves were 2-3 on the season after last weekend's tournament at Florida Gulf Coast and finished this one 2-3.

Looking to even their record at 3-3, the Seawolves played No. 25 Kansas in the first game of the tournament. Despite an early 2-0 lead, thanks in part to a solo home run from senior Bria Green, the Jayhawks came right back and tied the game, scoring runs in both the fifth and sixth innings. The back-and-forth contest continued until Jessie Roane hit a game-winning RBI single in the 10<span style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 22.2222232818604px;">th</span> to give Kansas a 3-2 victory.

The second game of Friday’s doubleheader came against Siena. Looking to rebound from the first loss, Head Coach Megan Bryant sent freshman Maddy Neales to the mound. Neales' 6 strikeouts led the Seawolves to a 2-0 victory. Once again, Stony Brook was led on offense by Bria Green who went 2-2 with an RBI.

On Saturday, the Seawolves once again faced Siena. This time, Stony Brook was unable to hold the Saints' bats down. Siena was able to hold a 6-5 lead into the last inning. The Seawolves, however, were able to mount a two-out six-run rally to defeat the Saints for a second time, 11-6.

The second game on Saturday against South Dakota was cancelled due to weather conditions.

On Sunday, Stony Brook played a twin-bill with North Florida, losing both matchups. The Ospreys jumped out to an 8-0 lead in the first inning of the first game, and the Seawolves could not recover, losing the matchup 10-6. The Seawolves cut the matchup to 8-5 in the fifth, after Allie Pisciotta drove in Lexie Shue with a single, but North Florida scored two runs in the bottom of the sixth to put the game away.

Game two was much tighter, as the Seawolves fell 5-4 in eight innings. Green belted another home run in this one, this time a two-run shot, and after four innings the game was knotted at two. Stony Brook was down 5-3 in the bottom of the eighth, but could not rally enough. Kim Ragazzo led off the inning with a pinch-hit double and then scored later on Green's single. Melissa Phelan lined into a double play to end the game.

Stony Brook heads to Harrisonburg, Virginia next weekend to take part in the James Madison Invitational, which features matchups with the Dukes of JMU, Maryland, and Rhode Island.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The best attack in baseball is a balanced attack, and that is what Matt Senk and his Stony Brook baseball team had Wednesday afternoon, taking down the Fordham Rams 6-5 to take a three-game series with the Bronx, N.Y. school.

Mother Nature did not affect the bats, as seven different Seawolves recorded a hit in the matchup and three different players recorded an RBI. In that mix was Jack Parenty, as he launched a two-run home run to right in the top of the second.

It was errors that doomed the Rams in the first, as Stony Brook plated a pair of unearned runs as well as another to take a 3-0 lead before Fordham even had a plate appearance.

Parenty led off the game with a walk and worked his way home, eventually scoring on a throwing error by Fordham starter Donald May to get Stony Brook on the board.

Handley also worked a walk to get on base, and he eventually found his way home when Cole Peragine chopped an RBI groundout to second base to double the Seawolves lead in the first.

Stony Brook increased their lead to 3-0 when Andruw Gazzola touched home after Johnny Caputo reached on a fielding error by first baseman Matthew Kozuch.

The Rams cut the lead back to one in the bottom half of the first on a Charles Galiano long ball. The junior catcher drilled a Nicholas DiEva pitch to left-center, bringing Kozuch home in the process.

Parenty got the two runs back with his bomb to left-center, the first of the season for the junior outfielder. He also drove in Jeremy Giles.

Fordham was able to tie the game in the bottom of the third and fourth, scoring a pair in the third before knotting it up in the fourth.

Joseph DeVito tied the game at five in the fourth, roping a single to left to bring in Ryan McNally and bring the Rams back even.

The Seawolves took the lead back for good in the top of the seventh, courtesy of Gazzola. He laced a single to right, bringing in Toby Handley to make it 6-5 for good.

Kevin Kernan got his first win of the season, throwing three solid innings, only allowing one run while striking out a pair of Ram batters.

It was Teddy Rodliff picking up his second save of the campaign, throwing the final three innings and only allowing three baserunners. None of them were able to go past second base.

America East play begins this weekend for the Seawolves, as they host the defending champion Binghamton Bearcats for a three-game set. Two games will be played on Saturday, and then one matchup on Sunday.]]></content:encoded>

Brands were pulled from shelves for not correctly listing ingredients.<em> CHRISTOPHER CAMERON / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman delivered a cease and desist letter last month to GNC, Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens because store brands of herbal supplements did not contain the ingredients stated on the labels.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tests show the products did not contain any of the herbs they said they did. Instead of medicinal herbs, they are said to have fillers like houseplants, powdered rice and asparagus. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Food and Drug Administration has had little control over the supplement industry. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 exempts supplements from the FDA’s approval process for prescription drugs since they are considered foods, not drugs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dr. Arthur Grollman, director of Zickler Laboratory of Chemical Biology at Stony Brook University School of Medicine, is considered an expert on the topic and was asked to comment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“This study undertaken by Attorney General Schneiderman’s office is a well-controlled, scientifically-based documentation of the outrageous degree of adulteration in the herbal supplement industry,” Grollman said in the Attorney General’s Feb. 3 press release.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Grollman has not done research on this specific case, but has testified in the past to get Ephedra, a supplement that was linked to health issues and deaths, off the shelf.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“It took the FDA 10 years to get Ephedra off the shelf, but it took 3 days for the Attorney General to take these supplements off,” Grollman said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since there is no approval process, it is very easy for potentially dangerous supplements to reach the market and the FDA has an extremely limited control over supplements, Grollman said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“There have been no penalties against these [herbal supplement] companies, which has allowed these type of things to happen,” Grollman said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Grollman has been a critic of the industry for some time now.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I applaud the New York Attorney General for taking the additional step of seeking to remove these products from the marketplace,” Grollman said in the Attorney General’s statement, “as they can cause serious harm to consumers unaware of the actual ingredients in the pills and capsules they ingest.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since the cease and desist letters three weeks ago, the Attorney General announced that he would be targeting the manufactures of these products. He is ordering manufacturers to report the process of creating their herbal supplements by March 13.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Schneiderman wrote a letter to four manufacturers, including NBTY, Inc., which is located in Ronkonkoma and produces Sundown Naturals, Nature’s Bounty, Vitamin World and other brands. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The scientific community, public health officials, and others have raised serious doubt about the steps taken to ensure the safety and efficacy of the herbal dietary supplements taken daily by millions of Americans,” Schneiderman said in his letter. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Shneiderman also wrote that the New York Attorney General office will be conducting a broader investigation to see how retailers are going about representing and advertising their herbal supplements.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The current test used involves DNA, which allows scientists to identify plants and animals by looking for short strands of DNA and then comparing them to a national database. Some critics to this method say the companies use extracts of a plant’s active ingredients that may not show up in a DNA test. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“This is going to be the most revealing part of this case,” Grollman said about the mandatory reports on manufacturing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>Correction: March 3, 2015</strong></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em>A previous version of this article failed to identify the New York State Attorney General by his full name, Eric Schneiderman. </em></p>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[As noted in the front page article in the NYT today (3/30), GNC, the major herbal company in the US has embraced fully the use of DNA barcoding for herbal supplements and will institute this procedure promptly for identification of plant sources of their future products while discarding those that were removed from the shelves nationally, even though the latter were approved by USP.
Hopefully, other supplement manufacturers and eventually USP will promptly follow suit. Consumers of dietary (herbal) supplements deserve no less than full transparencies]]></wp:comment_content>

The Stony Brook women’s basketball team has hit its stride. Winning eight of its last ten games has granted the Seawolves the third seed heading into the America East Playoffs.

Throughout the season, Christa Scognamiglio has found her place on the team by providing them with a significant deep threat shot and solid all-around play.

This was not always the case for Scognamiglio. She faced situations in which it was not easy to display her talents on the court. Beginning her college career at Fairfield, Scognamiglio felt she was not given the chance to make the impact she knew she could.

Eventually, things changed when she decided to change scenery and make a fresh start nearly two years ago, transferring out of Fairfield and coming to Stony Brook to be a Seawolf.

“It took a while to get here, but I just kept working hard and wanted to be on the court,” Scognamiglio said of her transition to Stony Brook.

Through it all, some of the most influential experiences came earlier in Scognamiglio’s career.

Basketball came into her life at a relatively early age. Introduced to the sport by her father, Scognamiglio was playing in a CYO basketball league by fourth grade. It was there that she encountered the first taste of defeat and the disappointment that comes with it.

“When I was little, my Dad got me into basketball, starting out playing for fun. Then, in 4th grade, we lost our first game of the year 34-4,” Scognamiglio recollected, “It was awful, I never wanted to lose like that again.”

The worst defeat she experienced shaped her motivation toward this goal, and it has been this same motivation that she has carried over to her journey in college.

Scognamiglio arrived at Stony Brook with the understanding that she would have to prove herself to gain playing time. She had to overcome the fact that no one on the team had seen her play first, though.

“I came into the season wanting to help and be a part of the team in any way I could,” Scognamiglio said, “I did everything I could to prove to the coaches and the team that I could play.”

She has proven that she belongs here and her playing time reflects that.

Scognamiglio is averaging 7.9 points a night on 42.4 percent shooting from the field this season.

However, despite her success throughout the season, Scognamiglio is not only thinking about her college basketball career.

At the end of the day she has a life outside of college and a family to keep in touch with. Back at home Scognamiglio has her younger sister who plays basketball in a CYO League.

Along with talking to her sister about basketball, she enjoys hearing about her sister’s life. After going through a similar process years before, she offers up her well-earned experiences and advice as much as she can.

“One of my sisters is nine and she’s playing CYO now. So I love talking to her about it and her life. It’s funny to listen to a nine year talk about her issues,” Scognamiglio said.

Keeping in touch with her family helps Scognamiglio extend herself academically at Stony Brook. With a major in business, she one day hopes to incorporate her passion for sports into a job. Knowing what field she would like to pursue, however, does not necessarily make the future much clearer. Like most college students, she finds herself in the awkward, yet common, “I’m not sure what I want to do in life,” phase.

“I definitely want to stay in sports. I don’t know if it will be in basketball, but it will be sports in business. Maybe sports management. Still thinking.” Scognamiglio said.

For now, the focus will be set on the current season. She is now nearing the end of her first full year as a Seawolf. In that year Scognamiglio has earned her spot as a starter on a team that will be looking for her presence in the coming years.

With playoffs coming up, she hopes to make an impact and help lead the team to a championship.

“In playoffs anyone can take anyone in a game so we have to keep our confidence up and keep playing as hard as we have been.” Scognamiglio said.

“We play Hartford Sunday, hopefully that will make it four wins in a row heading into the playoffs. I think that puts us in a really good position.”

Whatever the result may be for the Seawolves this year in the playoffs, Scognamiglio will continue to push herself and drive to be the best.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_36220" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-36220 size-medium" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/kryssymassa_blackhistorymonth_2-600x450.jpg" alt="KRYSTEN MASSA / THE STATESMAN" width="600" height="450" /> The word "Sankofa!" comes from the Akan language, which finds its origin in Ghana. It specifically refers to the Black Experience of those affected by the African Diaspora.<em> KRYSTEN MASSA / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

The room was filled with round tables draped with black table cloths and decorated with purple and gold plates. Students filled the seats during the Black History Month closing ceremony last Wednesday, Feb. 25 in SAC Ballroom A.

Among the students was Zoe Sumner, a sophomore English major.

By the end of the night, Sumner was named the first- place winner of the Spoken Word contest.

This contest, which was held on Wednesday, Feb. 11, gave Stony Brook students the chance to recite an original poem in front of their peers.

This contest happens annually during Black History Month. The theme, like previous years, was “Sankofa!” The Evolution of the Black Experience.

For Sumner’s winning performance, she focused on the theme of black femininity. She wrote about black women in today’s society.

“The idea of a black woman has been commoditized,” Sumner said.

In her poem she talked about features typical of a black woman—for example, a big butt—and how those features are only appreciated on people like Kim Kardashian and Beyoncé.

Sumner, who is also the step coordinator of the Cadence step team, said that this was her first year being really involved with Black History Month at Stony Brook.

“I definitely think that people from all races should come out to these events because it’s not just about black people,” Sumner said.

She added that black history is not taught as much in high school, so it would be good to see more students of different races come to the events on campus during the month.

Another popular event was the Black History Month forum on Feb. 19. Kevin Powell, a black political activist, led a discussion with student leaders.

Soledad O’Brien’s talk at the Staller Center on Feb. 16 was another highly-attended event during the month of February.

The key note speaker at the closing ceremony was Dr. Allison J. McLarty, a cardiothoracic surgeon and associate professor of surgery at Stony Brook Medicine.

McLarty spoke about her struggles pertaining to her race and gender that she faced to get where she is now.

She talked about the power of education for students and about how her mother, a Jamaican native, always pushed her to achieve her dreams.

She opened her speech by talking about “Sankofa!”

“Loosely translated, it means that it is not wrong to go back to that which you have forgotten, or another way to look at it is that there is sometimes a need to reflect on the past, so that one can build a successful future,” McLarty said.

She talked about how her grandmother told her mother that since McLarty's mother was the darkest of all of her children, she needed to study the hardest so that she could make her way in the world.

She then talked about how her mothers work habits rubbed off on her and helped her to become the person she is today.

When she was told that she could not be a doctor because she was a woman and because of her race, she listened to her mother who told her that she could.

“There is a lot of power in our choices and I think a lot more than we realize,” McLarty said. “Each of us has the power to choose the path that makes our dreams come true.”

She also talked about how inspiring it is to think of people like Oprah and Obama as icons of the black community.

She said that just their presence is liberating.

“I also think of what it took them to get to where they are now,” she added.

She talked about how diligent people like  Oprah and Obama worked hard to get to where they are today.

She said that it is this generation’s job to make it easier for the following generation by minimizing racism.

“It is up to us to change things so that our children see a world where it is normal to be where you are, it is normal to be black wherever you are,” McLarty said. “So that we are not a color, we are just a people collectively trying to become everything that we have been created to be.”

The night was also filled with student awards for participation and achievements during Black History Month as well as vocal performances. The night ended off with a buffet-style dinner.

Dr. Zebulon Miletsky, an assistant professor of Africana Studies was one of the organizers of Black History Month at SBU  this year. Miletsky said he received a lot of positive feedback on the speakers they have had at the events during the month.

He said that every event has been like an “ongoing dialogue.”

Miletsky said this year, with the killings of unarmed black men like Mike Brown and Eric Garner, they wanted to make Black History Month resonate more with students and their own experiences.

“I think people are looking for answers. Everyone is looking for ways to weigh in on this national conversation,” Miletsky said. “I look at Black History Month this year as a needed conversation and a needed healing too.”]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The story behind SBU hockey&#039;s &quot;Green Line&quot;</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_36491" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-36491" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/hanaa.tameez_mar1_hockey11-600x398.jpg" alt="HANAA' TAMEEZ / THE STATESMAN" width="600" height="398" /> Stony Brook club hockey's Nick Barbera and Vincent Lopes have combined for 114 points, a huge testament to their on-ice chemistry. Off the ice, Lopes credits Barbera as being his "best friend here." <em>HANAA' TAMEEZ / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

During practices, it is typical for hockey teams to assign each of their forward lines different colored jerseys. This has been the case for the Stony Brook hockey club. And while other players on the team have changed their jersey color multiple times over the years, forwards Vincent Lopes and Nick Barbera have always worn green.

There has never been a need for the two seniors to change practice jerseys. The pair has skated on the same line for their entire Seawolves careers.

“I played with Nick Barbera pretty much my entire time here,” Lopes said. “We have really good chemistry out there. I know where he is and he knows where I’m going to be pretty much all the time.”

This season, Lopes and Barbera’s chemistry has been stronger than ever, as the two linemates have combined for 114 points and are a major reason Stony Brook will have the opportunity to participate in another National Tournament this weekend.

“He’s probably the best player in this league,” Lopes said about Barbera. “Just having him on my line has helped me achieve what I’ve achieved this season and in my entire career here at Stony Brook.”

Playing on the same line has forced Lopes and Barbera to spend plenty of time together, and a result of this has been the development of a strong off-the-ice relationship between the two.

Last week the two men could be spotted walking around the mall, alongside teammates JT Hall and Sam Brewster, just killing time together before practice.

“This year, we’ve really been hanging around a lot,” Barbera said. “It’s going to be sad once the season is over, because I’m really going to miss hanging out with Lopes and everyone.”

“Off the ice he’s my best friend here, so we carry that on the ice,” Lopes added.

Over the years, many players have rotated in and out as the third man on their line, and this year it has been Hall who has found a home with Lopes and Barbera. The sophomore forward has thrived in the role of the line’s main distributor, leading the Seawolves with 38 assists this year.

“Once us three were put together, they couldn’t break us apart. We just clicked so well,” Barbera said. “I really think that our line in particular is what has gotten us going this year.”

Next year there will likely be at least two new players donning green jerseys at SBU hockey practices, but Lopes and Barbera will have an opportunity to cement their legacy in the program this March when they try and bring the club its first national title.

The premise also served to be an educational factor for viewers. <em>MANJU SHIVACHARAN / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

&nbsp;

On Thursday night, award-winning playwright Mike Lew appeared at the Staller Center’s first show of 2015 to watch his own play, “Bike America,” in action.

“Bike America” took its audience on a colorful, laughter-filled journey across the United States as they watched its performers travel from Boston to Santa Barbara. They stopped in cities like New York, Austin and Memphis along the way during the performance.

Some play goers were leaning forward on their seats, admiring how the playwright, director, technical crew and performers were transporting them throughout the states on such a small stage.

The crew was able to use lighting and sound to represent Penny, the play’s main character, being hit by a truck driver.

Additionally, the lighting crew was able to represent each state the set was entering by flashing a bulb on a map; the audience was able to visualize the distance the story took the characters across the United States once each bulb was lit.

“I thought the character Penny had a love-hate kind of personality but I thought that the story was very relatable. At times I hated Penny [the main character], but then I loved her,” Cristian Maraver, a student taking an introduction to theatre class at Stony Brook, said.

Members of the audience applauded the production.

The majority of the crowd remained seated after the show for a question and answer session.

Professor Kenneth Weitzman hosted the Q&amp;A session. He began by opening up with a few questions touching upon Lew’s influences, visions and expectations of the performance.

Lew said that there were some “aspects that [he] could still work on” and that his play has “changed a lot since the first draft.” Lew was happy to notice that the performance included a lot from his original script that other directors sometimes choose to leave out.

Weitzman then opened up the interview to the play’s director, Kara-Lynn Vaeni.

When asked about her original plan to incorporate bikes into the set, Vaeni said that her “first thought was to use stationary bikes,” but after seeing people on them in the gym, she realized, “that was just so boring.”

After brainstorming a few other possibilities, she arrived at the idea of just cutting the bikes in half.

Reducing the size of the bikes seemed to work wonders for the set. Instead of riding bicycles across the stage, each cast member held on to the handlebars and one wheel of a bike that was cut-in-half.

These props almost resembled unicycles, but the actors mimicked riding a bike by moving their feet constantly throughout each act.

When the script would have them speed up, they would lean forward on their bikes and run, when they were riding up a hill they would lift their bikes up, and when they needed to slow down, they would move their feet casually.

Performing “Bike America” gave the university’s actors the opportunity to work with and perform in front of an award-winning playwright, something they collectively described as a “wonderful experience.”

“Bike America” performances will run until Sunday, March 8. The show plays on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 2 p.m.

Tickets are $10 for students with Stony Brook I.D. and $20 for general admission.<strong> </strong>

		<title>Barbera&#039;s SBU hockey journey coming to a close</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For Nick Barbera, winning ACHA nationals would be the culmination of over twenty years of playing hockey. After being a semi-finalist on last season’s Seawolves hockey team, Barbera knows what it will take to win it all.

“Nationals is really a different type of game. At nationals, you need to play more simple, you really just need to work hard,” the senior winger said. “When all the guys on our team work as hard as we can, there’s no other team that can match us with skill and talent.”

Hard work has paid off for the Stony Brook hockey team all season long, as the club had a 19-1 record in the ESCHL en route to a third consecutive division title.

Barbera has been a major reason for his team’s success, scoring 24 goals and 31 assists in 28 games played this season.

Barbera, a lifelong New York Rangers fan, says the NHL players he has been compared to the most are Rick Nash and Joe Thornton, first liners for the Rangers and San Jose Sharks, respectively.

“They’re big, they’re tall. They each have a long reach and are able to possess the puck and keep it away from opponents.” Listed at 6-foot-1-inch and 215 pounds, Barbera uses his size to his advantage in the offensive zone.

For Barbera, hockey has been an important part of his life from a very young age.

“Well my dad got me onto skates when I was about two. He used to just hold my hands and skate me around the rink, and then ever since then I was hooked.”

The Kings Park, N.Y. native played for the Long Island Royals, a junior hockey program, for over a decade throughout his childhood, winning the USA Hockey Junior B national championship in 2008.

After the sociology major graduates next winter, he may not be ready to hang up the skates yet.

“A few people have contacted me about possible trying out for a semi-pro team in Pennsylvania or Florida. I’d have to think about that,” Barbera said. “I would love to continue to play hockey as long as I could.”

With a chance to add another national championship to his resumé in Cleveland, Ohio in a few days, the thought of a post-college playing career is the least of Barbera’s concerns.

His focus is solely on earning the ACHA National Championship.

“[Winning the championship] would mean everything to me. I know how much our coaches have been dying to win and they know that this year is our year to win. We just have the right players and we can pull it off this year.”

For Barbera, the key to winning Nationals, in his mind, is all about effort. One quote he often thinks about is “Hard work will always beat talent when talent doesn’t work hard.”

Stony Brook hockey has the talent to succeed, and with leaders on the team like Barbera, its difficult to imagine that they will not put forth the hard work they need to on the ultimate stage.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On paper, 5-foot-10-inch, 175-pound senior Vinny Lopes may seem unfit to play a sport as physical as hockey.

He may have the body of a baseball player, but Lopes possesses the heart of a hockey player.

“I was just always told that I was too small and I was too little, physically,” Lopes said.

Due to his untraditional hockey physique, Lopes heard this type of criticism throughout his upbringing.

Using his personal strengths to reach his ceiling potential, Lopes has forged an illustrious collegiate career for the Stony Brook men’s hockey team.

Originally a defenseman, Lopes made a decisive change that proved an integral transition for his success on the ice.

“I made the conversion to forward just to use my speed and maximize my game. I overcame that adversity of people telling me I couldn’t play defense,” Lopes said. “I used it in a different way to play the forward position,” Lopes exclaimed.

Playing with a chip on his shoulder, Lopes has evolved into a talented hockey player with a determination to win.

The senior from Staten Island, N.Y. led the Seawolves in scoring with 25 goals and 54 points this season, en route to the club’s third consecutive ESCHL championship.

He also had a team leading seven game-winning goals this year. But Lopes is quick to give credit to the whole Seawolves club for the success the team has  had this campaign.

“We really came together this year,” Lopes said.

After an overtime victory versus Delaware to claim the division title, the No. 5 ranked Seawolves will prepare to play the No. 12 ranked Rhode Island on Mar. 7.

Lopes is determined to bring Stony Brook its first national championship.

Lopes expressed the importance of going out in style prior to graduating and leading the program to victory in the 2015 ACHA Men’s Divison I National Championship.

“It means everything,” Lopes said. “To leave here with a national championship and a ring on my finger would be the greatest thing that could possibly happen,” he continued.

Born and groomed a hockey player, Lopes’ passion for the sport has him considering playing beyond college hockey.

“Possibly I would think about going overseas,” Lopes explained. For now he is intent on obtaining his diploma to pursue a career in financial advising.

Lopes described prioritizing and time-management as the most difficult aspects of a student-athlete’s success in the classroom, and in the competition.

With nationals right around the corner, Lopes’ love for the game has him committing his time to bringing the ACHA Cup home to Stony Brook.]]></content:encoded>

The ceremony aimed at giving Stony Brook University students a taste of Bengali Wedding culture. <em>CHRISTOPHER CAMERON / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

Bengalis Unite cordially invited everyone to the beautiful traditional “wedding” of Ahmad Fordous and Sofya Pugach on Saturday night.

It was a night to remember, as Fordous and Pugach took their fake vows in the lovely LDS Center venue. Approximately 190 guests shared the night with the “bride and groom,” enjoying good food, colorful performances and great company.

Bengalis Unite is a student group on campus. They want to share the traditions of Bengali and South Asian culture while bringing together people of all different backgrounds.

This is the third mock wedding hosted by the club. The event has previously won an Undergraduate Student Government award for best social event.

Bengali is comprised of the cultures from the Bengal region.

The Bengal region consists of the independent nation of Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal, but is represented throughout the world and greatly represented on Stony Brook campus.

This mock wedding reflected a traditional South Asian wedding, from the attire to the rituals. A wedding is typically a several-day affair but was wrapped into one eventful night.

The lighthearted playfulness of the mock ceremony had the guests giggling in their seats. The bride, biochemical engineering student and Russian beauty Pugach, was adorned in a gold and red Bengali lehanga. The charming Fordous of Pace University in Manhattan looked dapper in a traditional Punjabi pajama.

The blushing bride and groom then exchanged garlands. In a real wedding the exchange of garlands is happening while the purohit, who officiates the wedding, chants mantras, representing the unity between one another.

After garlanding, the bride and the groom are made to look at each other in front of all their guests. This exchange of loving glance is called shubho drishti. No, kissing is not involved in this ceremony.

The guests were then treated to lively performances by the SBU Bhangra group, which danced to upbeat music associated with Punjabi culture and Indian fusion a cappella group SBU Yuva. Yuva performed a rendition of Indian music fused with some catchy Bruno Mars.

The big hit of the night was the club’s Executive Board and friends performing a dance representing the bride and the groom.

Dance groups wowed the guests with their colorful and coordinated presence. SBU De taali, a south Asian a cappella song/dance group, SBU Raaswalas and the SBU Belly Dance Troupe hit the floor and left the guests wanting more.

Second year running President of Bengalis Unite, Business Management student Syed Abrar Hossain, said “We had this event three years back. We decided we should bring all the successful events back and give people a sense of what a Bengali and South East Asian wedding looks like.”

When asked what makes this event special, he said, “ Because we are a cultural club, we should show what our culture is like. We don’t see events like this on campus, something really unique, I want people to have a good time.”

Aside from mock weddings, Bengalis Unite is involved in various charitable causes, like raising money for sports kits for orphans. The group's fundraiser last semester, “Soccer for Care,” featured an organized soccer tournament at the Campus Recreation Center.

In a real Bengali wedding, by the end of the night, the couple would be preparing for the festivities to come the next day.

After about 18 rituals and about a weeks worth of celebration, the couple is officially joined in holy matrimony. Thanks to Bengalis Unite, in about three hours, the mock Mr. and Mrs. Fordous can now celebrate a lifetime of mock love and happiness.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Stony Brook University has a more diverse undergraduate population than SUNY Buffalo, SUNY Binghamton and the total SUNY undergraduate student population, according to SUNY Common Data Sets. The least represented races on SUNY campuses are African Americans and Hispanics, each making up 10.1 percent of the total SUNY undergraduate population. In comparison, African Americans and Hispanics represent 17.5 percent and 18.2 percent, respectively, of the population of New York State, according to the 2012 Census.

As a percentage of total population, Stony Brook has a much larger Asian population than Suffolk County. Suffolk County’s white population is nearly twice as large as the University’s as a percentage of total population.

Nationally, the racial gap in high school graduates who attend college has narrowed. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, 70 percent of white students continue on to college, compared to 65 percent of black students. Black students are still less likely to graduate with a degree. According to Department of Education data, of students who entered college in 2005, 62 percent of whites graduated with degrees in six years versus 40 percent of blacks and 51 percent of Hispanics.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The issue and attack of Charlie Hebdo is a difficult topic to discuss out of fear of offending someone, betraying my own ever-changing values, or of the unfortunate circumstance of saying something I do not necessarily mean. The topic is by no means a comfortable conversation to have with anyone. My final belief is Charlie Hebdo is an event that floats in a shade of grey, teetering between two very opposing sides. This in itself is a struggle to try and understand, especially when the world seems to be split so easily into two opposing sides.

Charlie Hebdo is a weekly newspaper filled with editorials, cartoons and pieces that make fun of everything and everyone. Past publications have caricatured Judiasm, Christianity and Islam in unflattering tones, portrayed a former Pope as a Nazi Officer because of his past as a (forced) member of the Hitler Youth and blasted feminist ideals. It petitioned to have one of its own national parties removed from the French government. It has been sued several times by religious institutions (mainly Catholic) and from 2006, by Islamic organizations as well for its insensitive cartoons.

The shootings that took place in Paris were brought on because Charlie Hebdo, the small, satirical publication of France, drew a caricature of Mohammad. Though the Quran might not explicitly forbid drawings and visual depictions of the Islamic prophet, there are several supplemental teachings, or “hadith,” that clearly do not allow a visual representation of him. In other words, it is forbidden.

The attack that killed eleven cartoonists and editors, and one police officer, on  Jan. 7, 2015 was an extreme reaction to the publication of a cartoon which depicted Muhammad.

It is an extreme reaction to an insensitive cartoon.

In light of the state of affairs in the world, in light of the constant scrutiny and criticism that Muslims face living outside of the Middle East, in light of what can be seen as an oppressive majority’s feeling towards a minority and in light of how important religion can to be an individual, the cartoon was insensitive. That is all that can be said about it.

Because Jimi Hendrix’s 1967 album cover of him standing with his bandmates as various forms of Vishnu, a Hindu God, is insensitive to Hinduism. So is a Christmas episode of “Family Guy,” where the characters try to get Jesus laid. I cannot  imagine orthodox Christians laughing here. Every holocaust joke, every politicization of the Jewish population, it is all offensive. It is all a low blow to those who practice the respective religions.

But none of these incidents have the gravity to justify an attack like that which took place in France. Not even the cartoon.

To support the terrorist action or even just to say the publication should not have done what they did because they should not “poke the lion” of terrorism, is not the right train of thought. It puts Islam above all other religions, instead of on the same playing field as Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, etc.

Charlie Hebdo published so many offensive cartoons against Catholics and Jews, and the only thing those religious groups have tried to do is sue the paper. Modern-day life is offensive to nearly every faith, but people are not being shot for pregaming the football game or in defiance of religious views on premarital sex.

In a world that is losing its sensitivity to all faiths based on a lack of education and carelessness, taking personal offense to every slight against your respective religion cannot be the solution. When the Islamic community became defensive and condemned the publication for its cartoon as soon as the attack struck, it became so easy for governments and large populations to turn their backs against the community as a whole, catapulting the #JeSuisCharlie movement into something so much bigger than it had to be.

Suddenly, what started as the act of two independent terrorists ended up representing an entire faith. Suddenly, the only real “real Muslim” seemed to be the terrorist. Tragically, we lost sight of the Muslim police officer who was also shot and killed by the same terrorists that opened fire at the Charlie Hebdo office.

The times where we see our personal ideals being attacked is not a time for movement and retribution. It is a time to open up a conversation and delve deep into discussion about why something is wrong, how it is offensive. Before this entire situation, I was unaware that drawing Muhammad was forbidden. Several discussions with friends later, and now I understand the reasoning behind it as well.

The caricature was unflattering and rude to have published and in the eyes of the Muslim community it was wrong. But nothing justifies the murders of the writers and cartoonists, especially in France, where publications like this dating back to the times of Voltaire were responsible for breaking the “Catholicity” of Christianity.
Life today is not dictated by an autonomous rule of religion that suppresses any movement against it. This is not Europe circa the thirteenth century.

The attack at Charlie Hebdo exists in a very uncomfortable realm of grey because to look at the situation carefully and understand it for what it is, it requires you to have one foot in one ideal and the other in another. We can only begin to understand the moral complexity behind Charlie Hebdo when we understand why everything they have published is so offensive while continuing to support its right to do so.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Sexwolf: The new S-word</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I do believe feminists around the country have taken the liberty of beating the concept of the double standard into every head and skull throughout America. We are all acutely aware of the fact society celebrates men who are wildly sexually active and shames women who behave the same.

No man would dare argue against this for fear that a feminist would jump out from her hiding place in her own armpit hair and beat him half to death with her burning bra.

Please note this depiction of feminists is not accurate. Lots of us shave our armpits at a frequency that almost borders on often and appreciate what bras do for us when we run down stairs.

Despite the fact we are all aware of this double standard, very few of us actually do anything about this oppressing view. And I believe I’m friends with all of them. Most of us, unfortunately, propagate it.

I propose that we eliminate all the s-words and w-words that can’t be printed in a university newspaper from our vocabulary and replace them all with a new term: “sexually liberated,” the sex-positive adjective described someone who has freed themselves from the restraints of society’s oppression. Whether or not this person involves themselves in other restraints is optional.

The negative words generally reserved for women who are sexually active without a significant datemate does much more than pit women against each other. It pits everyone against the idea of sex, both men and women. When society views sex as an activity men perform on women (speaking exclusively of heterosexual sex), men become the subject, treating women as the object. And so I propose the liberation of the idea of sex.

The consequences of such a simple but important change would be felt everywhere.  Sex would not be such a taboo subject anymore.  It would be something we are all free to talk about and question and enjoy. Maybe there wouldn’t be sexually-active 24 years old who have never had an HIV test because it would be ok to ask for one.

Maybe there would not be women about to graduate college who do not know where their clitoris is because they would feel comfortable exploring their own body.

Maybe there would not be 13 year olds who lose their virginity to someone much older because they would understand what was happening.  Maybe there wouldn’t be victims of date rape who are afraid to tell their story because society would stop blaming women. And maybe, there wouldn’t be celibate sex columnists.

I encourage all of you, my readers, those who read my column because I force you to, those who read it because the word sex makes you giggle, those who read it because you actually read the newspaper, and those who read it because you think I am Kathleen Valerio who works in student-health services, please change your perspective on the idea of sex.  Let’s change that s-word we call women to sexually liberated.]]></content:encoded>

Both teams failed to make the winner's circle. <em>STATESMAN STOCK PHOTO</em>[/caption]

The Stony Brook men’s and women’s track teams headed to The Armory in New York City back on Feb. 20 and 21 for the America East Indoor Track Championships.

Unfortunately, neither team was able to finish in the top half of competing teams. The men finished seventh overall and the women finished fifth.

Although the teams both failed to crack the final winner’s circle, freshman Kaylyn Gordon did make some history of her own. She set a school record with a 5.92 meter long jump and was crowned America East champion in that category.

This performance earned her the championship’s Most Outstanding Performer and Rookie of the Week honors. Gordon became the first Seawolf in the program’s history to win Most Outstanding Performer.

Another high point of the championships for the Seawolves occurred during the 3,000 meter and 1,000 meter runs on the women’s side. Junior Christina Melian finished 18 seconds faster than anyone else in the 3,000 meter run, while freshman Jane Clark was the runner of honor for the 1,000 meter run.

This marked the second consecutive season Stony Brook won the women’s 1,000 meter event, as Olivia Burne won it for the Seawolves in 2014.

The highest placing Seawolf on the men’s side was Lamar Hayes, who finished third in the 200 meter dash finals.

Albany won both the men’s and women’s championships for the day. The men’s team accumulated 191 points, 57 more than second-place Binghamton. Albany’s women recorded 197.66 points, with Binghamton once again finishing a distant second.

Regarding point totals, Stony Brook’s women fared better than the men did. The women’s team recorded 83 points in comparison to the men’s 46.

If you have not noticed already because you were too busy texting, Stony Brook has decided to take the fatherly role of reminding us to put away our phone so we do not get hit by a car.

In the crosswalk border between the steps to isolated Tabler Quad and the rest of Stony Brook’s campus, now there is a nice big “LOOK” sign written on the ground. Administration plans to implement this in many more major intersections throughout campus.

The proposal is an interesting and helpful one; in general, people have become so dependent on others and technology recently that the school feels obligated to remind us that the outside world (like traffic and roads) exists and can be dangerous.

Who knows, maybe they will provide us with crossing guards that hold our hands while we cross the road and help us even more.

As thoughtful as Stony Brook is in this situation, if they really need to put warning signs for crossing a road, how are we living up to our new role as “adults?”

We are in the stage where we leave our parents’ home and go to school to learn a trade so we can provide for ourselves in the future. If we cannot even put away our cell phones when crossing the road, our generation’s future looks pretty bleak.

In the past, college was seen as a rite of passage to adulthood, where we grow as people and become the builders of society.

The dorming option was implemented to make it easier for people to learn the valuable life skill of independence. However, for the recent generations, this plan backfired. Now, we feel more entitled; we are given everything and only have to study, which many of us do not even do.

There are no worries for food and shelter and we assume we have nice jobs waiting for us right after graduation. We have fleeting relationships and hookups to fulfill our desire for significant others. We have begun to feel like high-schoolers again, except with the new privilege of being by ourselves.

This brings about a generation of people who take things for granted and feel like they do not need to work for anything. We have no role models, no one to look to as a symbol of struggle and accomplishment. Before doing something, our only line of reasoning lies in if this action will give us some sort of pleasure. We give in to the temptations of relaxing and having fun in meaningless ways. These effects multiplied over the past couple decades, and now more and more people are embodying this hedonistic mindset of entitlement and carelessness.

The world outside of the college sphere started to evolve as well. With the influx of hard-working immigrants who would take part-time classes and work for survival at the same time, the privileged and entitled fell behind. What happened to the bright future they assumed they would have? These people have started to think of college as a failed investment, thousands of dollars gone down the drain with little return of investment.

We are reaching adulthood later and later with every generation; we might look like adults, but we sure do not act like adults. If we were trying to act like responsible adults, Stony Brook would not think of us as people who need reminders to pay attention while crossing roads.

To show how far we are from responsible, the idea of a 18-year old-man getting married, working 12 hour shifts daily and having kids is repulsive and scary to us. However, that  hard-working man would look at an average American 25-year-old guy “in between jobs,” living for the Friday and Saturday nights when he can hit the club and sleeping around with many women disparagingly.

Guess what? Our ancestors had lives more similarly to the 18-year old man, and apparently we are taught that we are better than people of the past. Are we really? How long can this modern hedonistic lifestyle play out, until we burn out? This warning to look while crossing the street only encourages this careless, entitled mindset.

Maturity is seen as a state of mind that is reached after a person has gone through immense struggle and pain that makes them realize their true purpose in life.

Is it any wonder that our great-grandparents, grandparents or even our parents married and started working much earlier than we did? They matured earlier because of the struggles they had to go through.

Are we even reaching maturity? Are we really mature adults ready to embark on a life journey of dedication and perseverance, like marriage, jobs, kids and other commitments? Or is this collegiate stage an illusion of independence, failing to prepare us for the hard life that is ahead of us?

The school telling us stop texting so we do not get hit by a car is only a metaphor for this sad state our peers are in nowadays.

We are being slowly rocked to sleep in our cradle covered by a pink woolen blanket while there is so much outside that we are kept ignorant of. College nowadays keeps us sheltered and oblivious to the world outside, which is tough and filled with struggle and turmoil.

We think we will be able to lead good lives after college as long as we “follow our heart and do what we love.” However, with struggle taken out of the collegiate equation, we have more struggle setup for us ahead with little preparation for it.

We have not seen the real world yet and the reality is clouded with our pursuits of pleasure.The warning sign for crossing the road is another example of the university system babying us. We need to take responsibility for our lives, actions and commitments.

Even though the school had good intentions behind this action, this is a reminder for us that our childlike behaviors are only becoming more prevalent, and not in the good “child-at-heart” type of way.

If we can not even be careful when we cross a road, too involved in the cyber world of keeping tabs of other people, how will we be careful with the rest of our own lives?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_36453" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-36453 size-full-width" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ENTER_MOVIE-OSCARS_172_ZUM-600x421.jpg" alt="PA WIRE / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE" width="600" height="421" /> "I have an idea. How about, instead of having an award category for best movie in the eyes of white males who are paid to decide what movies to snub, we have a category that is entirely decided by the audience?" <em>PA WIRE / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE</em>[/caption]

The Oscars have come a long way since its humble beginnings. From celebrating the best movies of the year to celebrating the best actors and actresses out in the world, the Oscars have always been a staple of American television around this time of year. Who won? Who wore the best dress? Who got snubbed?

Well, I can answer that last question: everyone who is not a select group of 1,000 or so people got snubbed. Every single year the awards season becomes more and more worthless as the population grows. Now that people can see a movie whenever they want, those who are apart of a select group of voters should not be the ones to pick which gets labeled as “The Best Movie.”

You have to go back to 1997 to see this clearly. The last time a movie won for “Best Picture” and also took home the real, coveted award of “Top Grossing Film” was James Cameron’s “Titanic.” That is naturally wrong considering that in the 18 years since then, only a few of the top grossing films of that year  have taken home any Oscars whatsoever.

The film industry needs revenue to survive, so why are the movies that attract the most attention or gain the most notoriety not favored to win every year? Clearly, the films that have done well and gained the most money were the most popular, so just give them a pity award at least.

You may be reading this and thinking, “Oh, well it doesn’t really matter, they make the money but the real acting comes in smaller films.” That is not the point. The awards season has become such a joke in many respects due to their complete lack of recognition to movies that were a success.

The reason this matters is simple. The Oscars, for whatever reason, are still the awards people look up to. They are still the awards that 50 years from now, people will go, “Oh, in 2014, the award for best movie went to Birdman, so that clearly must be the best film of all of 2014.” That is the important thing here. It is not up to the audience whatsoever to decide who gets awards anymore. Sure, there is the People’s Choice Awards, but how many people in the world watch that compared to the Oscars? 10.36 million people tuned in to watch the People’s Choice Awards in 2014 while 43 million watched the Oscars in the same year. That staggering difference is the problem.

What I am saying is that we need to change how movies are rated. The awards do not reflect how popular a movie was or if it was the best. In the eyes of the audience, clearly the best movie of 2014 was “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1.” It earned leagues of money higher than the next movie on the list, “Interstellar.” So why do these movies earn no formal recognition? Because they are not good enough for a select group of people we call “the critics.”

As 2015 rolls around, we need to realize that the system does not work anymore. Clearly the audience always speaks with money, and the money is not talking. Awards should not be given out by a select voting committee that is made up of 77 percent white males; only 2 percent of the votiung members are black.

This discrepancy in voting and accountability has really ruined the idea of awards and it is time to find a new system. A system that honors the movies that truly made the audiences come back for more. A system that people enjoy to watch because it said “In reality, movies like ‘Captain America: Winter Soldier’ and ‘The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1’ were important in 2014 and should be recognized for drawing the most audience appreciation and revenue.”

I have an idea; How about instead of having an award category for best movie in the eyes of white males who are paid to decide what movies to snub, we have a category that is entirely decided by the audience? Just nominate the top-10 grossing movies of that year and then have the audience decide who the true winner of that year is. Sure, there can be a “Critics Choice” category, but we have passed the point where select people should be telling the world what movie was the most important.

Or, if you want to play on a leveled playing field, stop nominating movies 90 percent of the people have no interest in. I am sorry, selection committee, but having your viewership drop 18 percent in one year is indicative of just how disconnected you really are from the American public.]]></content:encoded>

Though the game did not go well for the Seawolves at first, the team would emerge with a 14-10 victory.<em> CHRISTOPHER CAMERON / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

After edging out Fairfield at home, the Seawolves looked to stay on a roll against the undefeated Marist Red Foxes in the first of their two game road trip on Wednesday, March 4. Stony Brook came away with the 14-10 win against the Red Foxes.

It did not start that well for Head Coach Jim Nagle's squad. The Red Foxes got on board first with a goal in the first minute of the game from senior attackman Colin Joka off an assist by freshman attackman Gannon Morrison.

In the seventh minute of play, Seawolves junior attackman Brody Eastwood got his twelfth goal of the season, the first of three in the game, off of an assist by sophomore midfielder Ryan Bitzer.

The Seawolves could not celebrate for long, as Joka got the pass from Morrison and scored once again a few minutes later. After seeing what Joka was doing, senior midfielder Michael Begley decided to join the party and score his eighth goal of the season for the Red Foxes. With a 3-1 lead to end the first, it looked like the Seawolves were in for a tough loss.

The second period proved to be an offensive showcase for the Seawolves, starting with junior attackman Matt Schultz. Never one to give up, he gave the Seawolves a jump start by scoring one off of a great assist by senior midfielder Mike Rooney. Rooney was not done dishing the ball either, this time hitting sophomore attackman Chris Stemke for the 3-3 tie.

Schultz gave the Seawolves their first lead of the game with his second goal, this time coming off an assist by junior midfielder Chris Hughes. The Seawolves lead was short-lived, however, as Marist's junior attackman Joseph Radin brought the game to a 4-4 tie.

Try as they might, the Red Foxes could not stop Eastwood, who scored his second goal of the game giving the Seawolves the lead once again. Hughes also scored his first goal of the game. The Red Foxes ended the period with a goal by senior midfielder Drew Nesmith, bringing the game to a 6-5 Seawolves lead.

The Seawolves started the third period red hot, as junior defenseman Dylan Curry got on the board, scoring his second goal of the season. Two minutes later, Hughes got his second goal of the game to extend the lead. Eastwood got his third and final goal as well, scoring off of junior midfielder Challen Roger's assist.

The Seawolves' four-goal run came to end as Joka scored his third goal for the Red Foxes. That sparked a Marist four-goal run. Sophomore attackman John Vigh and Radin both scored off of assists by sophomore attackman J.D. Recor and Begley scored his second. Hughes had the last laugh with 12 seconds left in the period, as he scored his third off of a Rooney assist, bringing the score to 11-9.

Rooney started the fourth period off with a bang as he scored his second goal just 32 seconds in. Marist answered back with another Radin goal, this time off a Recor assist. They could not seal the deal, however, as Curry and Rooney both scored.

The Seawolves continue their road trip with a game against Rutgers on March 8 at 2 p.m. They then start a homestand, playing America East rivals Albany on March 14 and UMBC on March 21.

It is a great way to balance exercise with relaxation.  <em>LOS ANGELES TIMES / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE</em>[/caption]

Lets face it, not all of us will be on the next flight to Cancun the second we get out of our last class before spring break. Most of us won't even be stuffing just enough belongings into a car for a week-long road-trip. Some of us will actively seek things to do out in the fresh air, but for those of us who understand the true comfort of home, who needs the real world?

Besides, it might be called “spring break,” but here in New York we know that is a lie. It is cold outside. My soul is seeking solace from the blistering cold. Dorothy called it, there really is no place like home.

If you are like me, there will be plenty of things to do during a glorious week-long staycation. If you need some inspiration to be a better homebody, you can steal a few plays from my book:

&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li>Endless Netflix Marathon: What kind of list would this be if I didn’t include a day long marathon of Orange is the New Black? During the next few weeks of the semester, there won't be time to indulge without feeling a twinge of remorse. Live it up now! And let's be real, Friends is not going to watch itself.</li>
	<li>Try out Pinterest recipes: One of my favorite things to do when I am home from school is cook and bake. My recipe board is filled with gooey cookies and soups and other easy-to-make dishes. Anyone you live with will love you when they see a mound of surprise food. Even your dog or cat, I promise.</li>
	<li>Arm Knitting: That is not a typo. I really do mean arm knitting… as in no knitting needles required. It may be a little tricky at first, I speak from experience, but at the end you will have a pretty awesome scarf that you can’t buy at the mall.</li>
	<li>Read a book: Old fashioned, I know. Trust me, it is much better than it sounds. All you have to do is get to a library or a bookstore, find a comfy spot and let your eyes do the rest. Maybe it is time to read 50 Shades of Grey because “your friend is making you.”</li>
	<li>Start a Journal: A lot of super creative people keep journals. If you want your friends to think of you as #artsy, this break is a good time to break in that untouched Moleskine you bought on a whim because who doesn’t want a fancy notebook? Writing daily helps improve your voice and skills. It is a win-win.</li>
	<li>Try an At-Home Workout: Imagine how cool it would be to not leave your home, and days later emerge a super-toned Adonis? Everyone will be wondering how you did it. While a week may not produce such dramatic effects, at least it provides some time for squats and lunges. It is time someone give Kim K. a run for her money.</li>
	<li>Learn a Cool Party Trick: First thing that comes to mind is to learn how to juggle. You can start small with mastering pulling a quarter out of someone’s ear and work you way up. You will never be the victim of an awkward silence as long as you have a skill.</li>
	<li>Make Oobleck: When I was first introduced to this mystery miracle substance, I was in awe. Still, to this day, I could play with it for hours. There are tons of recipes online and a Dr. Seuss book to go along with all the fun! If you have never heard of Oobleck, I recommend you question your childhood and make a batch now.</li>
	<li>Refine Your Yoga Skills: I am not an expert, but from what I hear, most people feel yoga is a great way to relax but also exercise. Honing the right skills during spring break can help down the road when finals hit. If that is not enough of a reason, you could finally use the hashtag #yogaeverydamnday on Instagram! <strong>* </strong>sun, moon and star emojis*</li>
	<li>Hibernate: The rest of the semester most likely will not allow for much sleep. You may as well catch up on it now while you have the time. Bears have to do it and they don’t even have eighteen credits, a roommate, friends and family to worry about. Take this time to treat yourself.</li>

The season came full circle for Jameel Warney on Wednesday night when he stepped to the line for two crucial late-game free throws.

Back in Stony Brook’s home opener against Columbia, Warney went 0-6 from the free throw line and nearly cost the Seawolves the game. On this night, he made up for what seemed like a huge blunder back in 2014 by nailing two game-sealing free throws in SBU’s 62-57 quarterfinal win over the Binghamton Bearcats.

"Knew it would be a dogfight. They're in every game," Head Coach Steve Pikiell said following the win. "Survive and advance. That's what we did today. I'm real pleased with the outcome against a team that's been playing really good basketball."

The game became a shootout early, with Binghamton knocking down five of its first six shots and Stony Brook keeping pace with a couple of threes. The Bearcats responded to an early 8-4 SBU lead with a 7-2 run behind their full-court pressure defense.

Both teams were in double-digits by the 14-minute mark, but the game settled down as both teams' defenses began to clamp down. Redshirt freshman Roland Nyama was all over the Bearcats, forcing turnovers by drawing charges and swiping at the ball. On the other end, Binghamton’s zone was a logjam for both Warney and the Seawolves’ shooters.

Warney attempted just four shots in the first half, heading into the break with three points.

"I always have a struggle against the Binghamton zone," Warney said. "I just have to find ways to be aggressive and my team was doing well shooting."

To make matters worse for the two-time America East Player of the Year, his frontcourt partner Rayshaun McGrew was forced to sit with two fouls midway through the period. Pikiell turned to a small lineup with Chris Braley at the four, but the lineup failed to score in three minutes and committed three turnovers.

"They really don't have a true center, they really have a bunch of wing guys. With the foul trouble we thought he was a good matchup," Pikiell said. "We can go small too. We prefer to play big but Ray was in foul trouble so we had to switch that up a little bit."

Freshman Tyrell Sturdivant then checked in to provide a spark of five points and junior Carson Puriefoy was aggressive in looking for seams in the defense, but the offense as a whole struggled for most of the period. Stony Brook missed 12 straight field goals during one stretch and shot just 30.8 percent from the field in the first half.

"I liked the shots we were getting. I thought we had great looks," Pikiell said. "Hard for Jameel, every time he caught it [there were] two guys on him so he can't get shot attempts. He loves to pass anyways."

Binghamton took advantage, heading into the halftime break with a 25-23 lead behind eight points from Willie Rodriguez. The Bearcats possessed the rebounding edge through 20 minutes and went only eight deep, while SBU played ten players.

The second half looked like a carbon copy of the first until the Seawolves went on an 14-0 run at the 17:24 mark to take a 41-30 lead, their biggest of the night. The run included a Scott King three and alley-oop slam, sending the Island crowd into a frenzy.

"That's what [King's] been doing for us," Pikiell said. "He's been been great for us coming off the bench."

The Bearcats would respond, of course, in the form of a 7-1 run. However, Puriefoy stepped up with a 5-0 spark of his own to keep Binghamton behind by double-digits.

SBU’s defense was at its peak form throughout the second period, forcing ten Binghamton turnovers.

"Offense is the most inconsistent part of the game, we know that," Puriefoy said. "In the playoffs we need to rely on our defense. We know we're a great defensive team and we can rely on that when our shots aren't falling or our offense isn't giving us what we want. We just had to buckle down in that first half when we were missing shots and we kept it close so that we could make a run in the second half."

Stony Brook could not pull away though, clinging on to a shallow six-point lead with just over five minutes to play. Warney then took over, finding McGrew with gorgeous passes on consecutive possessions and quickly making his quiet shooting night look obsolete. He then snatched up a big offensive rebound and scored with 2:36 to go, putting the Seawolves ahead by seven.

Marlon Beck II cut the Stony Brook lead to four on a step-back three and a Kameron Mitchell turnover led to a free throw on the other end for Binghamton, making it just a three-point game. Following four straight missed free throws from Puriefoy and McGrew, Binghamton’s Justin McFadden missed a wide open three to tie the game. Warney iced two at the line to seal the win for Stony Brook, 62-57.

"We've been through this a lot of times this season when we've been down, can't score, but we know if we keep on sticking together we'll be fine," Warney said.

The Seawolves will travel to Vermont on Sunday, March 8 to try to defeat the Catamounts on their home court for the first time since the 2009-10 season.

"We can play with any team in this league," Pikiell said. "I'm excited about going up there."

The next day, he was scheduled to lead a street protest against the Russian actions in Ukraine, a major demonstration against the power of Putin." <em>LOS ANGELES TIMES / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE</em>[/caption]

On Feb. 27, an assassin gunned down Boris Nemtsov, a noted Russian opposition politician and outspoken critic. This event sent shockwaves throughout the international political community and sparked a great debate about the motives of such a killing. Nemtsov was one of the greatest critics of current Russian President Vladimir Putin, leading many to believe the assassination was a politically-motivated conspiracy.

Nemtsov was killed while crossing Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge after sharing a meal with his girlfriend. His killer soon fled the scene and a manhunt is currently underway in Russia to find him. Leaders from nearly every world power soon condemned the slaying. Putin himself also condemned the killing, but there is great amount of doubt regarding the veracity of his words.

Nemtsov was shot four times, one bullet for each child he leaves behind.

His assassination came at a crucial time for him. The next day, he was scheduled to lead a street protest against the Russian actions in Ukraine, a major demonstration against the power of Putin. He also claimed to have evidence of Russian troops in Ukraine, an immensely damning piece of evidence against Putin if true. Needless to say, Putin had plenty of reasons to order such an assassination.

The man’s own mother feared for his life, and he somewhat feared for it himself. Putin is at best a paranoid autocrat, at worst a tyrannical despot. He feels the constant need to consolidate and demonstrate his power. The simple logic of this event holds that Nemtsov pushed too far and Putin had his life ended.

Nemtsov was a smart man, a physicist by education who had published over 60 papers over his career. Putin is a smart man, too. He may be a thug, but his political moves are calculated. Assassination is both a sign of weakness as much as it is a warning. Ordering Nemtsov killed would mean he feared the man, and fear is a dangerous emotion to demonstrate. Putin would also possibly open himself up to intense criticism and international sanctions, two things he could not afford. The Russian economy is in turmoil, and the same oil money that made Putin beloved has been taken away from him. Putin does not have the same power a true dictator such as Kim Jong-Un has in his country; revolution is his greatest fear.

It is possible this slaying was a result of a deranged gunman, terrorists or any other explanation. I cannot tell you, as an American college student, that you are going to get a great answer to this conspiracy from me. But none of this really matters.

The world has become too enamored in the intrigue of this event and the debate on who to assign blame to that it has forgotten that this is a tragedy. Nemtsov was a voice for peace and a voice for freedom. Whether the man behind the gun is motivated by a corrupt government or a corrupt heart, the world has lost a small battle in the fight to become a better place.

But we have to swing back.

We should be celebrating Nemtsov’s messages and trying as hard as he was to make the world a better place. He may have not have wanted to become a martyr, but that’s the best thing he can be at this point.

His assassin has not succeeded yet. His goal was not to end Nemtsov’s life, but to kill his message. Together, though, we can overcome the evil behind this action. Gunshots may have silenced a single outspoken voice, but those gunshots can be silenced by the clamor of tens of thousands of people who want to be heard, all spreading the word of peace and freedom that a man gave his life to speak.]]></content:encoded>

Thanked the workers outside in the blistering cold for shoveling the sidewalks? Told a SAC dining chef that you really enjoyed your meal?" <em>BASIL JOHN / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

College students are some of the most blasé people in the world.

Yes, I see you shaking your head like, “No, that’s not me.” Lies. It is you.

Though I certainly am not one to point fingers at anybody, I fully admit that I too am a very indifferent person to many things. Last semester, I saw a kid get aattacked by a goose like he was its next meal and thought nothing of it.

But can I be blamed? I have seen at least three goose attacks a day since my first day on campus, and while I am ready to write a full-page petition to kill the next goose that defecates on the sidewalk, I am not here to talk about these festering animals. Like the brutal battle of man against bird that has been apart of Stony Brook since the dawn of time, there are many services on campus that go unnoticed and unappreciated by the Stony Brook student body.

When was the last time you stopped and spoke with a bus driver? Thanked the workers outside in the blistering cold for shoveling the sidewalks? Told a SAC dining chef that you really enjoyed your meal? We have grown so accustomed to these services that we are hardly even phased by the amount of time and effort that may have gone into making them happen, and we need to be more aware of this. We need to take a second to say the two words almost every custodian, chef and bus driver never seems to hear: thank you!

When I am not here at school, I work in daycare facility in my hometown and I can tell you right now the two types of parents that exist in this world. There are the ones that chat for an additional two hours by the door, smiling and getting to know you, and the ones that grab their offspring by the wrist and leave like the building is about to burn down. I am well aware that these parents pay good money just to have a few hours free of coloring with crayons and changing diapers. I do not expect any mother, on top of the stress of carrying for herself and a family, to thank me for doing a job that I am paid to do.

However, I would be lying if I said it did not make me feel better about myself to hear positive recognition or acknowledgment of my work. Again, it is not something that I anticipate happening; after all, it is my job. But I hold out hope that someone would stop and take a moment to say that they appreciate what I am doing.

Yes, I am at times a hypocrite outside of my job. I am aware that I too stumble into West Side Dining, grumble my order for curly fries and retreat to my room, no “thank you’s” exchanged. But I try to make an effort to ask workers how busy their day has been or what their plans are over the weekend.

Like the stressed out mothers-of-three that I know, students are often exhausted, over-worked and struggling to get to class on time. I am sure not many people have the time or energy to strike up a conversation with a complete stranger. But we, the struggling broke college students, almost all know the feeling of having to work a job where your efforts often go unnoticed. And it sucks. My friend is a waitress, and each time we go out to eat, she leaves at least a $10 tip because she knows the pain and suffering that our poor waiter/waitress had to go through.

I think it is time we start leaving our $10 at the table. No, do not actually leave money behind at in a dining hall, but thank a bus driver for driving around campus all day, a custodian for keeping the buildings beautiful, or even thank a taxi driver for driving a good portion of the student body back to campus Thursday-Saturday night. It is not necessary, but considering the number of things done for us as students everyday, it almost should be.]]></content:encoded>

Kameron Mitchell at Washington. Scott King at Albany. Stony Brook has relied on unlikely heroes in its biggest wins of the season, and such was the case against Vermont in the America East semifinals. Freshman Deshaun Thrower scored 18 points, 16 in the second half, including the dagger with 25 seconds to go to propel the Seawolves into the America East Championship game in a 79-77 win over the Catamounts.

The Seawolves made the same mistakes that hurt them against Vermont twice during the regular season in the first half of this game. The Catamounts opened up on a 10-0 run with a couple of pick-and-pops that resulted in wide-open jumpers.

Shooting for Stony Brook early was junior Rayshaun McGrew, who took home all-conference third team honors. He took SBU’s first six shots, but connected on just one of them despite getting good looks.

To help spark a Seawolves offense stifled by Vermont’s high-pressure man defense, Head Coach Steve Pikiell quickly subbed King in to replace Roland Nyama. Soon after, Pikiell brought in Nyama to play alongside King for one of the first times this season. These changes did not make a world of difference, as Stony Brook would use three timeouts in just over seven minutes of action.

Jameel Warney eventually got it going with a seven-point spurt, but Vermont still held a solid lead behind back-to-back threes from Cam Ward. To no surprise, long-range shooting was a trend for Vermont throughout the half, heading into the break shooting 8-of-12 from deep. While some were contested makes, many were the result of overhelping by the Seawolves.

By the 11:37 mark, six Catamounts had scored while Stony Brook scrambled to maintain pace on the other end. Junior Carson Puriefoy played a dreadful half, going 0-of-4 from the field and picking up three fouls. Stony Brook’s best looks came on offensive boards, the one area the Seawolves excelled in through the first 20 minutes.

The Seawolves went into halftime with nine offensive boards to Vermont’s three and 19 total rebounds to Vermont’s 15. Everything else was a struggle for Stony Brook, however. The Seawolves connected on only one three in the first half. Only two players, Warney and McGrew, scored five or more points and even they could not take advantage of Ethan O’Day resting on the bench to close the half.

O’Day killed Stony Brook in the two meetings between the schools this season, but when he sat out most of the final eight minutes of the half, Hector Harold picked up the slack with a seemingly effortless 13-point half. His spark helped give Vermont a 41-29 advantage heading into halftime, with the Seawolves shooting just 33.3 percent from the field.

Then, the tables turned. Stony Brook came out of the break a new team: energized, crisp and determined. The Seawolves went on a ridiculous 28-6 run to start the half, fueled by improved play in every facet.

Puriefoy broke out his stupor, cashing in on a quick five points to light the fuse. With his confidence brimming, Puriefoy began shooting, and making, with vigor. Puriefoy scored 15 of his 17 points in the second half, shooting 4-of-6 from the field.

A solid first half was not enough for Warney, who began dominating. Almost every rebound seemed to fall in his hands, and he was able to muscle his way into post position for a 13-point period. He finished with 24 points and 14 rebounds on the afternoon.

Then there was Thrower, who played 19 minutes in the second half thanks to his pesky defense, 3-of-3 shooting from deep and aggressive play on the fast break. The freshman pushed the tempo and attacked the paint relentlessly.

The Catamounts regressed from downtown, shooting just 2-of-8 from three in the second period despite getting relatively the same looks. SBU’s momentum rattled Vermont, but did not completely take the Catamounts out of the game.

With the Seawolves taking their largest lead of the night at 11 points with just over nine minutes left to play, Vermont fought back. The teams began trading buckets until Stony Brook’s offense began to dial back and its defense being hampered by foul trouble for Puriefoy and McGrew. Down three at the 3:08 mark, Kurt Steidl knocked down a three, with Mitchell closing out to tie the game.

Warney gave Stony Brook control with a right hook shot. Following a Puriefoy steal, McGrew tipped in a Warney miss to give SBU a four-point lead. Vermont’s Dre Wills finished a reverse lay-up to make it a two-point game with 56 seconds remaining. With time winding down and the play broken, it was Thrower who bailed out the Seawolves on a fading mid-range jumper to extend their lead back to four and secure them the victory.

Stony Brook will now head up to Albany on Saturday to take on the Great Danes, with a chance at finally reaching the NCAA Tournament.]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While most Americans eat bananas imported from Latin America and South America, Hawaii is the only place where bananas are commercially grown in the U.S., according to “Fun Banana Facts.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">In the early 15th century, Portuguese sailors transported bananas from West Africa to Europe, “aboutfood” said. Although they found bananas in West Africa, the fruit may have originated in East Asia and Oceana. This week’s College Gal Cooking recipe is for Banana Dream Boats.</span></p>
Ingredients

6 Bananas

½ cup mini marsh mellows

¼-½ cup milk chocolate morsels

¼-½ cup milk butterscotch morsels

3-6 cubes of Hershey’s Cookies and Cream bar or milk chocolate bar

2 tbs granola

Strawberries

Honey

Cinnamon (optional)
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">First, place the bananas side by side on their spines on a cookie pan. Then, make an incision along the center of the bananas. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Open the bananas enough to make adding the ingredients to the inside of the banana easier. It is okay if they get somewhat mashed in the process.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then, add the marshmallows to the inside of the banana. Add the milk chocolate and butterscotch morsels and bits of the Hershey’s Cookies and Cream bar to the bananas. Feel free to change up the types of chocolates you use in the recipe. Once the chocolates are in, dice and add pieces of strawberries to the recipe. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The banana will widen as you add the ingredients. Crush some granola and sprinkle it onto the bananas. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Make sure the granola goes inside the banana. To top off the recipe, place more marshmallows on top to seal the ingredients into the banana.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Set the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and place the finished bananas into the oven. Let the bananas bake for 15 to 20 minutes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Make sure you keep an eye on the recipe as it cooks. The marshmallows need to melt without getting crispy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you want to change up the ingredients, instead of using marshmallows, squeeze some honey into the bananas and use your desired ingredients. Parts of the banana’s skin will turn black as it cooks.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When the bananas are ready, take them out of the oven and allow them to cool for a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>minute or so—the skin will be hot to the touch, so be careful. Once they cool slightly, grab a spoon and dig in.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Women&#039;s basketball rallies late, but is unable to avoid upset loss to UMBC</title>

However, this was not enough, as the Seawolves lost 49-47 against the UMBC Retrievers. <em>BASIL JOHN / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

UMBC had never lost at the Events Center on Binghamton’s campus in the America East Tournament, holding a perfect 3-0 record.

However, it was the Stony Brook women’s basketball team that came to the center refusing to lose, fighting from 10 points down with 5:45 remaining, only to lose on a shot with four seconds remaining, 49-47 on Saturday night.

Refuse to lose.

That was the mantra of this Seawolves team heading down the home stretch in the second half, as Stony Brook fought to find a way to break down UMBC’s zone defense, a scheme the Retrievers used against Head Coach Caroline McCombs for the first time all season.

As the Seawolves found out, the three-point ball was not the answer, as the team went 5-of-25 from deep in the game.

The solution was sophomore point guard Kori Bayne-Walker, who took over the contest as the best player on the court in the second period, helping the Seawolves mount a serious charge.

Refuse to lose.

The same motto held true for Bayne-Walker as she tried to level the game in the final minute, ball in hand, looking to make a play.

The conference’s leader in assists took matters into her own hands. She drove down the lane and put up a touch shot that bounced in-and-around the hoop, only to setlle on near the baseline.

Refuse to lose.

Bayne-Walker was not ready to take the long bus ride back to Long Island quite yet, as she grabbed the offensive board, her sixth rebound of the game, and put it back in with seemingly a million hands in her face.

After a quiet first half with only four points, Bayne-Walker’s explosion, which included making both of her three-point attempts in the period, carried the team in its second half comeback.

However, it was not to be, as freshman Taylor McCarley of UMBC put her shoulder down on a drive towards the middle of the court on the other end, forcing up a shot that clanked off the backboard and in, giving UMBC the lead.

Bayne-Walker had a chance to bring the idea of “March Madness” to life, as she took the inbound pass with 3.3 seconds left, rushed down the court and threw up a heave.

As the ball fell back down to earth without swishing through the net, so came an end to Stony Brook’s first season under McCombs in an upset loss to the sixth-seeded Retrievers. As the Seawolves headed back to the bench to congratulate their opponents, senior Sabre Proctor, who was named as an All-America East First Team selection, rose up with her right leg wrapped, crutches in hand.

With time winding down in the first half, Proctor, who led the team in scoring and proved to be a threat in the post and beyond the arc, collided with a Retriever.

She ended up sitting out the rest of the game with her leg raised up on a set of chairs wrapped in ice. It was later revealed that she suffered a sprained knee.

That in itself made the Seawolves comeback all the more impressive.

Although it did not earn the team a win, Bayne-Walker scored 17 points in the second half alone after accounting for just over 11 per-game on the season, making up for the loss of the team’s scoring phenom.

Fellow senior Jessica Ogunnorin did her best to postpone the end of her Seawolves career as well. While Stony Brook struggled to sink long-range shots early, Ogunnorin did everything she could, on and off the dribble scoring 10 points in the period to keep the team in it.

Sophomore Christa Scognamiglio did what she could as well, draining Stony Brook’s other three long-rangers in her 11-point performance.

After a four to 14 to 24-win turnaround over the last few years, the Seawolves finished with 17 victories on the year. Losing Proctor and Ogunnorin next season, Stony Brook will look to reload in its pursuit of an America East Championship.]]></content:encoded>

If approved, it is estimated that 7,100 graduates will be enrolled in its first year. <em>PHOTO CREDIT: GOVERNOR CUOMO'S OFFICE</em>[/caption]

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo proposed a “Get On Your Feet” loan forgiveness program, which he declared would help students “get their feet under them so that they can get on with their lives,” as a component of <a href="http://www.governor.ny.gov/news/2015-opportunity-agenda-restoring-economic-opportunity-2" target="_blank">the 2015 Opportunity Agenda</a>.

The proposal is awaiting legislative approval and should be fully implemented by the 2019-20 academic year, according to a press release by the governor’s office.

The agenda presented ideas regarding the reform of New York State’s education system, greater economic opportunities for the state and a plan to revitalize the public’s trust in New York’s justice system.

“Many of our new college graduates face high student loan debt as they begin their careers and it’s a troubling situation because they have high debt and low wages,” Cuomo said in his Jan. 21 announcement at the Empire State Plaza Convention Center in Albany. “We want to help them get on their feet for the first two years.”

The “Get On Your Feet” program would be designed to allow eligible graduates to pay nothing toward their student loans for their first two years post-graduation. Students participating in “Get On Your Feet” would be enrolled in a Pay As You Earn (PAYE) loan repayment program, simultaneously, according to the governor’s press release.

The proposal states that in order to be eligible for the governor’s plan, students must meet three general requirements: attend college in New York and continue to live in the state following graduation, participate in the federal Pay As You Earn (PAYE) program and earn less than $50,000 annually.

Jacqueline Pascariello, director of Stony Brook’s Office of Financial Aid and Scholarship Services, stated that she does not see a part of the college application process changing from this proposal.

When asked about how this proposal may affect current Stony Brook students, Pascariello said, “We are very fortunate that Stony Brook students tend to graduate with less debt than the national average. So it would really depend on their actual pay-scale as to whether or not it [the proposal] would have any effect.”

“I think it’s a great idea,” Mukut Patwary, a senior business and information systems double major, said. “It will give students the chance to manage their post-grad lifestyles without struggling or asking their parents for help.”

“I think it [the proposal] sounds absolutely amazing but I wonder why this only happening now all of a sudden,” Mariama Diallo, a freshman political science major, said. “It almost sounds too good to be true, like it’s too easy.”

An international student’s perspective was not much different.

“I’m an international student, but I think this is good for students who don’t get enough help from their university,” Liqun Yin, a freshman electrical engineering major, said.

“I would like for students to be able to come out of college and say ‘I’m going to do things that I think are important and give back to society,’ and they won't have to worry so much about paying those loans back, so I really love the two-year forgiveness thing,” Stony Brook University President Samuel L. Stanley Jr. said about the governor’s loan plan at a meeting with student media on Feb. 18. “I think it's a great plan for the state.”

It is estimated that 7,100 graduates will be enrolled in the program during the first year, according to the governor’s press release. This number is derived from several calculations and percentages, including the total number of undergraduates per year in New York State, the percentage of those who meet the program’s eligibility requirement of residency (82 percent), and those with loan debt and salaries below $50,000 a year.

Cuomo’s press release states that the state expects over 24,000 enrolled post-graduates annually by the 2019–2020 year. The program is expected to cost $41.7 million when it is put into full force.

“I think [Cuomo]'s put money aside for it in his budget that would be able to pay for it, which is even better,” Stanley said. “It would be tougher if they said schools had to pay for it, but they didn't say that, so it's a good thing that SUNY's off the hook for that.”

“This plan is a good idea,” James Argyropoulos, a junior computer science major, said. “It will give students further incentive to stay in New York, and I think it will help out the tax pool.”

Does this proposal have the ability to make Stony Brook University a better option to prospective students?

“Remembering that it is a proposal and that not all the terms of the proposal have been worked out it is hard to say if it makes Stony Brook University more viable,” Pascariello said. “Our value makes us viable and I do not believe students will choose to come to Stony Brook because thinking they are going to be graduating with high debt and low incomes.”

“Studies show that students who graduate with debt are less likely to start a small business or to purchase a home,” the Governor’s press release states. “The consequences of defaulting on student loans can prevent a person from ever realizing their goals.”]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_37079" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-37079 size-full-width" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/CAPS-photoStatesman-Stock-e1415317764860-1024x768-600x450.jpg" alt="STATESMAN STOCK PHOTO" width="600" height="450" /> Some professors at Stony Brook University are becoming more cognizant about using trigger words when discussing sensitive material during lectures. Such words may cause individuals to relive a traumatic experience.  <em>STATESMAN STOCK PHOTO</em>[/caption]

As campus-wide attention regarding sexual assault is increasing, professors whose lectures contain sensitive subjects are becoming more aware of trigger words.

As defined by Christine Szaraz, a prevention and outreach counselor at the Stony Brook University Center for Prevention and Outreach, a trigger word is a word that can cause “people who have experienced trauma to re-experience that trauma, things can trigger intrusive thoughts, memories, feelings.”

Triggers are not exclusively a result of sexual violence. Some causes can also be military combat, witnessing violence and being held hostage, to name a few.

Szaraz said she has been approached more in the past few semesters than in semesters past by professors who are trying to considerately handle this issue. She guest lectures in some classes to teach students the realities of rape and other gender issues that are commonly brushed over by campus officials.

Kathleen Fallon, an associate professor of sociology at SBU, has worked with Szaraz to educate students on serious topics. When dealing with possible trigger words, Fallon gives students as much forewarning as teaching tools allow.

“I try to give fair warning before the lectures are given,” Fallon said in an email. “I try to let students know in the syllabus, on Blackboard, and the lectures before. I hope to prevent students from coming, who might be affected—or to let them know what they will be hearing about, if they do decide to come.”

In her two years of teaching at Stony Brook, Fallon has not encountered a student who has been affected by a lecture of sensitive nature. In Fallon’s experience at McGill University in Canada, while lecturing about school shootings, a woman experienced post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms.

Kylie Oradesky, a junior environmental science major who works in the Center for Prevention and Outreach, said she thinks the considerate introduction of sensitive topics is helpful. She noted the importance of recognizing that everyone has different words that may set them off and that acknowledging this can help people heal. As a student, Oradesky has seen the result of professor’s awareness of trigger words in her classes.

“I have been in classrooms where teachers have introduced topics of a sensitive nature, such as assault, rape, abuse,” she said. “We usually talk about what the problem is and have a discussion about it.”

According to Szaraz, opponents of the use of trigger words argue the trouble with giving students trigger warnings is that they can enable a victim to avoid their trauma to an extent that allows them to fall into a state of further poor mental health.

“It is important that we don’t infantilize victims,” Szaraz said.

She explained that instead, peers, friends, professors and counselors should put in the extra work and show they care by empowering those we know who suffer as a result of trigger words. Despite the opinion of those who believe avoidance at all cost is what is best, Szaraz said triggers can be anywhere.

Szaraz then took the perspective of a victim: “I can’t spend my life wrapped in bubble wrap avoiding the triggers. I need to learn skills to manage my reaction.”]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Suffolk County Legislator Jay Schneiderman is working to fund a study by the Stony Brook University School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences in hopes of proving that Millstone Nuclear Power Plant is at fault for increasing the water temperature of the Long Island Sound. </span></p>
<p class="p1">Millstone Power Plant is located in Waterford, Conn. Not only does the plant provide electricity to almost half of Connecticut, it is also the largest nuclear facility in New England. Nuclear facilities such as this one often generate more heat than is necessary to produce electricity, up to three times as much, Schneiderman said.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The reactors must be cooled down and as a result, the excess heat is discarded as a byproduct. Millstone uses a method known as “once-through” cooling to cool off its nuclear reactor, according to Schneiderman. The system pumps two billion gallons of water through the plant each day. When the water is released back into Niantic Bay, its temperature increases by 25 degrees Fahrenheit. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At this rate, the water is flowing at three times the rate of Niagara Falls, Schneiderman said. The entire volume of the sound, 18 trillion gallons, has been circulated through the plant twice since the inception of the facility. According to Schneiderman’s calculations based on data provided by the Millstone Environmental Laboratory, the Long Island Sound is heating up at a rate that is six times anticipated global warming rates. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Connecticut lobstermen first caught Schneiderman’s attention when they raised concerns about the dying lobster population. Many cold-water species have been declining over the last two decades including lobster, winter flounder and Atlantic herring. On the other hand, many warm-water species have been increasing in population like striped bass, Atlantic moonfish and summer flounder.</span></p>
Aside from disrupting the ecosystem, higher water temperatures also alter water column stratification by cutting off oxygen supplies to the bottom waters, thus increasing hypoxia, or the bacterial decay rate of organic matter. Schneiderman reached out to R. Lawrence Swanson, Ph.D., associate dean of the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences, for his expertise on these conditions.

“What we want to do is look at the historical data to see if there is any evidence that there are noticeable changes in water temperatures, where those temperature changes are and whether it’s likely that those changes are a consequence of evolving climate, or can they be directly related to the Millstone discharge,” Swanson said in a phone interview.

Scientists have noted the warming of the Sound for many decades. According to the Long Island Sound study, there is approximately $9 billion in economic value within the waters of the sound.

Schneiderman investigated and found more and more clues that pointed across the water. Schneiderman was alarmed to find a report that stated that Millstone’s monitors remained offline more than any other nuclear plant in the United States.

When Schneiderman took a trip to Connecticut to speak with plant officials about the fishy situation (or lack there of), they claimed any heat dispensed into the sound is insignificant. However, an aerial infrared image of the Long Island Sound taken by satellite says otherwise.

Under the Clean Water Act, Millstone must prove that it is not changing the biodiversity of the water body and that the best available technology is being used. Closed loop systems with cooling towers, a multi million-dollar investment, are the proper device, but are not used by the facility, Schneiderman said.

“Even if there are other factors warming the water in the area, can these two federally protected waterways, the Long Island Sound and Peconic Estuary, handle more heat?” Schneiderman said. “The reason why that’s relevant is because the power plant, under the Clean Water Act, has to get their permit reissued every five years to use the water body as a heat sink ”

The plant’s Clean Water Act permit expires in September 2015. Without research done to show that there are malicious effects by the group, Millstone could renew its license for another five years.

According to Ken Holt, a spokesman of Millstone, the facility has been providing the university with 40 years of research done by the Millstone Environmental Laboratory.

“I know [the state of Connecticut] will be thorough and diligent in their review, and I’m sure they'll make the right decision,” Holt said.

Schneiderman expressed his concern for finding approximately $79,000 for the study in a phone interview.

“I can’t tell you at this point whether I’ll succeed or not,” he said. “Some legislatures are questioning whether the county ought to be paying for that study, ‘Why isn’t the power plant paying for that study,’ or ‘Why isn’t the federal government paying for that study?’”

On Feb. 28, the Suffolk County Water Quality Review recommended funding for the study.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_36891" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-36891 size-full-width" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/DrObeid_medicine.stonybrookmedicine.edu_-600x900.jpg" alt="PHOTO CREDIT: MEDICINE.STONYBROOKMEDICINE.EDU" width="600" height="900" /> Dr. Lina Obeid, above, dean for research of SBU's School of Medicine, is optimistic for science and medicine as a whole after it was stated in a report that biomedical prominence is key to Long Island's economic resurgence. <em>PHOTO CREDIT: MEDICINE.STONYBROOKMEDICINE.EDU</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1"><strong>By Christopher Leelum and Jakub Lewkowicz</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Long Island economy is stagnating in many aspects and needs a multi-faceted rescue effort, according to <a href="http://www.longislandindex.org/explore/ffb1bb48-bb39-4018-995a-b71f36718b88" target="_blank">a new report</a> by HR&amp;A Advisors Inc., an economic, real estate and energy consulting firm. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The report, titled “Long Island’s Future: Economic Implications of Today’s Choices,” stated that the island’s biomedical prominence is a key leverage point for its resurgence. Places like Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory and Stony Brook University will carry the torch for Long Island’s revival.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">“In formulating an economic development strategy, it is advisable for a region to focus on an industry cluster where it already has a competitive set of assets to build off, rather than attempt to build something from nothing,” Shuprotim Bhaumik, a Stony Brook alumnus and partner at HR&amp;A, said in an email. “We believe that Long Island’s biomedical cluster is among the most ripe industry clusters on Long Island upon which to build such a strategy.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The report highlighted four key factors that have led to the decline of Long Island’s economy in recent decades: lack of employment options, stagnant population growth, decline in young families and high
housing costs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For example, the annual employment growth rate has slumped from 2.4 percent between 1970 and 1980 to just 0.8 percent between 2000 and 2010. The proportion of workers aged 25–34 has declined 5.6 percent since 1990.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">The study suggested that ramping up multi-family housing and building employment around biomedical clusters can save Long Island from its slide.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The report’s high projections for biomedical success would be extremely beneficial for the coming generations. A possible 75 percent increase in employment, totaling about 12,250 new jobs, could be on the horizon for Long Island by 2040. Combined with successful housing projects, $12.6 billion in income stands to be gained.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dr. Lina Obeid, professor of medicine and dean for research at Stony Brook’s School of Medicine, is optimistic. “It’s the most exciting time to practice cutting edge medicine and science,” Obeid said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stony Brook University is a leader in neurovascular, cardiovascular, and cancer research, Obeid added. New technologies allow for more advanced and meticulous research in the medical profession. She explained that for every $250,000 invested through grants—primarily federal—two or three researchers are hired.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“There are always positions that are open,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dr. Kenneth Kaushansky, dean of the School of Medicine and senior vice president of health sciences, said there is a great return-on-investment when funds go towards biomedical research.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“For every dollar invested in the School of Medicine, eight or ten come back to the economy,” Kaushansky said. “The job prospects are outstanding.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dagnia Zeidlickis is the vice president of communications for the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, which she said is celebrating its 125th anniversary of being a part of the Long Island economy. Founded at the end of the 19th century, CSHL began as a training center for those looking to teach marine biology. The lab is another key biomedical player in HR&amp;A’s economic playbook.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We have key research and education programs with places like Stony Brook, North Shore LIJ and Brookhaven,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Zeidlickis also mentioned a partnership with Broad Hollow Bioscience Park, a sort of business incubator located on the campus of Farmingdale State College.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“OSI Pharmaceuticals, a spinoff of CSHL, was located there until it was recently acquired after its research into a cancer drug called Tarceva,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bhaumik noted that Long Island’s multi-jurisdictional makeup makes things economically difficult, but
not impossible.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Each institution within Long Island’s biomedical ecosystem will need to self-assess how it can best support the cluster’s success,” Bhaumik said. “For Stony Brook, it could mean forging stronger connections between student and faculty groups on campus and the business community.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Investment in downtowns by creating more urban environments would attract younger workers and additional tracks on the LIRR would improve regional connectivity, the report said. New and improved infrastructure on Long Island would accompany a surging
biomedical sector.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The upshot of the report is “to create jobs in industries in which the region maintains a competitive advantage.” Zeidlickis seems to think “competitive” may be an understatement.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Long Island has been a magnet for the best and brightest scientists in the world who have made breakthrough discoveries,” Zeidlickis said. “The contributions it has made to the biomedical world have been huge.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

BRIDGET DOWNES / THE STATESMAN" width="600" height="398" /></a> The South Asian Student Alliance worked with the frat IND (above) for the educational program about rape rates in India. BRIDGET DOWNES / THE STATESMAN[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">F-Word and Gender Equality Week have brought attention to women's rights issues at home, and on Wednesday, Iota Nu Delta and the South Asian Students Association decided to focus on a part of the world that gets little attention.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the hour-long “Future Without Violence” event in the Student Activities Center on March 4, both groups led a discussion on domestic and sexual violence in India. They discussed topics such as victim-blaming in India and the way Indian police forces handle rape cases, as well as the frequency and effects of acid attacks.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Starting with a video called “Rape: It's Your Fault” by Indian comedy collective All India Bakchod, several South Asian women talked about the idea that following gender norms would prevent rape. This immediately jumpstarted a conversation about victim-blaming here in the United States and how both India and the United States are affected by it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The South Asian Student Association and Iota Nu Delta presented statistics concerning rape cases to the audience. According to the statistics, the only rape case that had a conviction in 2012 was the Delhi gang rape case in which a woman was raped by a group of four men and died two weeks later. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The case sparked discussion on the flaws in the Indian justice system.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When Jasjot Kaur, president of SASA, brought up that in India, marital rape is essentially legal under Indian Penal Code 375, the crowd was flabbergasted.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Women are still not given rights,” she said, “not even in our country, as progressive as we are.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yaruq Hassan, the vice president of SASA, moved the discussion to the mentality we bring to rape.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The only way we can change the mentality is through teaching kids that you have to respect women,” he said. “If they don't see [women] treated well, they won't treat other women well.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Acid attacks were also on the list of topics to discuss. A clip from the documentary “Scarred” was played, and attendees saw a testimony from acid attack victim Chanchal Kumari. It was eye opening for freshman biochemistry major Birav Shah, who said, “I didn't know of the acid thing until recently. I knew of it from 'Slumdog [Millionaire],' but not legitimately.” </span></p>
<p class="p1">President Saurabh Malik also found the attacks surprising.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Before I looked it up, I had no idea that that was actually a big deal in India,” Malik said. “I didn't know that was a method of violence against women.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Those were not the only topics discussed, as various students talked about <a href="http://sbstatesman.com/2015/02/03/sbu-faces-lawsuit-for-deliberate-indifference-in-allegedly-mishandling-sexual-assault-case/" target="_blank">a lawsuit against Stony Brook University</a> where a former student is claiming that the university mishandled her sexual assault case. Many students in the room were appalled by the alleged handling. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Students also questioned the media's involvement in presenting the rape case, wondering if the media did a thorough job of reporting on the issue. Many big ideas came out of the event, but according to Kaur, the biggest was that “we all can do something to better women's rights and human rights.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Malik furthered those sentiments, saying, "we need to make sure we understand the consequences of what we do at all times."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You shouldn't stay silent,” Hassan said. “If you don't speak up, you are giving more power to the person that wronged you. Don't be silent, speak up.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_36947" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-36947" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Marijuana_PhotoCredit_SunSentinel_TribuneNewsService-600x400.jpg" alt="SUN SENTINEL / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE " width="600" height="400" /> THC and CBD, found in marijuana, have different effects within cells, research shows. While THC is responsible for marijuana's psychoactive effects, CBD has shown promise in treating childhood epilepsy and has neuroprotective and antidepressant qualities. <em>SUN SENTINEL / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Scientists at Stony Brook University discovered the mechanism by which the main components of marijuana, THC and CBD, are transported within the cell.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The team of researchers, led by Dale Deutsch, Martin Kaczocha and Matthew Elmes characterized the binding of THC and CBD to fatty-acid binding proteins (FABPs) that act like shuttles in the cell.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">CBD and THC are identical in structure save for one bond, but have vastly different effects on
the body. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">THC can be seen as the “evil twin,” as it activates cannabinoid receptors and causes the psychoactive effects of marijuana. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">CBD, on the other hand, is the “good twin” and does not cause any psychoactive effects.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Understanding the way CBD works in the cell is important because CBD has shown promise in treating cases of childhood epilepsy and has neuroprotective and antidepressant qualities.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Both THC and CBD are found in the cell membrane due to their hydrophobic nature. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We know that these molecules do in fact localize in the cell membrane, but we did not know how they are transported through the cell in the aqueous cytoplasm,” Elmes, a Ph.D. student in Deutsch’s lab, said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was previously thought that CBD worked by inhibiting fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the "garbage can" that would discard of anandamide. The premise was that if the garbage can could no longer work, then there would be an excess of anandamide and its positive effects.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anandamide is the neurotransmitter naturally present within the body. Components of marijuana mimic some of the effects of anandamide.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Deutsch and his team were the first to show that while CBD inhibits FAAH in the cells of mice and rats it did not inhibit FAAH in human cells.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Therefore, in humans, the rise in anandamide as a result of marijuana usage could not be due to the garbage can being disabled.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Instead, Deutsch and his team found that there is a shuttle protein, FABP, that acts as a chaperone to bring THC and CBD from the cell membrane to the FAAH garbage can.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Normally, FABPs transport anandamide to FAAH. However, when marijuana is used, THC and CBD are present and compete with the anandamide to bind to the shuttle.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since there is competition, less anandamide will be able to bind and be ultimately degraded by FAAH. As a result, there will be more anandamide present and more of its positive effects. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The team initially used computer simulations to predict the binding of THC and CBD to FABPs and found there to be a favorable free energy of binding. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Interestingly, the affinities of FABP for THC and CBD are almost exactly the same as the affinity for anandamide, so it makes sense that they could be competing for binding,” Elmes said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Scientists quantified this relationship and the binding of THC and CBD to the FABPs through a fluorescence-binding assay. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">First, the baseline fluorescence level was measured by flooding FABPs with a fluorescent probe. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then CBD and THC were added. They observed a decrease in the fluorescence level, suggesting that the CBD and THC were able to bind to the FABPs, displacing the fluorescent probe that was initially binding. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“It’s one step in the right direction to understand how CBD might be working to treat things like childhood epilepsy,” Elmes said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The team has started developing inhibitors of FABPs to increase anandamide levels in the body. One inhibitor they developed, SBFI</span><span class="s2"><sub>26</sub></span><span class="s1">,raised anandamide levels in mice and and had pain-reducing effects. The team also plans to further investigate how THC and CBD work in other body systems and what players are involved to best harness the positive effects of marijuana.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

Last year, 461 colleges and universities participated, composting a total of 89 million pounds of waste. <em>STATESMAN STOCK PHOTO</em>[/caption]

From the hospital to the dining facilities, different departments across Stony Brook University have started their RecycleMania endeavors.

The kickoff to the competition was held on Feb. 1, 2015, and continues until March 28, 2015.

RecycleMania is an international competition where different colleges and universities compete against each other to see who can recycle the most in different categories. At the end of the eight weeks, the RecycleMania board, which is comprised of sustainability managers from different participating universities, decides the category winners and list the overall results.

Last year alone, the 461 colleges and universities involved collectively recycled and composted 89 million pounds of waste. According to the RecycleMania website, this prevented the release of 126,597 metric tons of CO2E into the atmosphere.

“As a result of participating in RecycleMania, Stony Brook University has brought positive attention to the importance of recycling and has mitigated impact on the natural environment,” James O'Connor, director of Sustainability and Transportation Operations, said.

To achieve the broader goal of a greener university, several departments are coming together to educate the campus community in their own ways.

One of the departments involved is the Office of Sustainability, which leads efforts in overall recycling opportunities around campus. Its ongoing goal is to curb e-waste, which is anything electronic—computers, batteries, phones, etc.—in order to defend their two-time title as the biggest e-waste recycler in New York State.

"Our goal for the 2015 RecycleMania is to recycle the highest quality of e-waste in the nation, finish first in the Gorilla category in New York State, and improve upon our waste minimization figures since 2014," O’Connor said.

The “Gorilla” category ranks colleges and universities based on the amount of recycled bottles, cans, cardboard and papers. Last year Stony Brook recycled 119,277 pounds in the category.

These goals for the department may not be new, but it hopes to achieve them through innovative, paperless mediums.

”Our Office of Sustainability and Department of Recycling and Resource Management have been focused on increasing promotions of the event using electronic (non-paper) mediums and continuous communications with university offices and student groups,” O’Connor said.

Besides just promoting RecycleMania through electronic means, the Office of Sustainability has also scheduled "Sustainability Outreach Days," where there will be events that promote sustainability efforts like RecycleMania. The next two outreach dates are March 9 and March 23.

“The competition serves as a good barometer of where we stand with recycling,” Gregory Monaco, sustainability coordinator, said.  “We have done well in the past few years. Now we are competing against ourselves. We want to [be] better. We want to improve ourselves every year.”

Like the Office of Sustainability, the Department of Recycling &amp; Resource Management is looking to spread awareness and create ways to promote the 4 “Rs”: reduce, reuse, recycle and rethink.

“What we're really trying to get people to do is use reusable items like bags, bottles, silverware and reusable cups,” Henry Mooney, student outreach coordinator for the Department of Recycling &amp; Resource Management, said. “But for those who are not using reusable stuff often, were trying to get people to put things in the right place, like bottles, mixed paper, and especially electronic waste.”

The department is taking a grassroots effort to use student outreach coordinators to highlight RecycleMania through presentations at hall council meetings and events, like the kickoff to the competition. Part of being a student outreach coordinator is to educate and promote recycling.

“I send emails, go to hall councils to give presentations and other forms of public speaking,” Mooney said. “In fact, last week we just recorded some PSAs with the school’s radio station, and they’ve been playing them, and we got an email from a student asking more about it.”

The dining facilities, through the Faculty Student Association, are also taking strides towards a more green community. In the past, the FSA has worked closely with the local farmers to reduce the university's carbon footprint and continues to do so this year.

“Campus Dining supports the preservation of the American family farm, reducing the carbon footprint of our supply chain, and giving back to local communities,” Carly Shephard, Campus Dining’s marketing manager, said. “Food that is grown closer to campus has fewer transportation emissions associated with it, is fresher and supports local farmers.”

In addition, FSA takes waste from campus dining and uses a composter in Roth Quad to turn it into mulch. The university then reuses the mulch to plant the flowers that are grown in the on-campus greenhouse.

“The benefit of [a composting vessel] is that it reduces the amount of material sent to landfills, thereby reducing the use of fossil fuels, and the carbon footprint of the campus,” Angela Agnello, director of marketing and communications for FSA, said. “So, the impact that the University community’s food waste would have on global warming is reduced as well.”

Even the Stony Brook University Hospital is involved. The hospital takes the competition a step further to compete amongst its own departments.

“Goals for RecycleMania include motivating staff to increase recycling efforts and reduce waste generation, as well as decreasing the university and hospital’s carbon footprint to positively impact the environment,” Carol Gomes, chief operating officer, said on the hospital’s CEO blog.

There is a consensus throughout the university that the main goal is not to win a competition, but to rather educate the community to live a more sustainable lifestyle.

“We feel positive action is the best catalyst for change,” Constantine Bournias, public relations officer of the Stony Brook Environmental Club, said. “Change begins on the individual level, and everyone can make a difference.”]]></content:encoded>

The revelation of last year’s Stony Brook women’s lacrosse season was the performance of their freshmen, with Courtney Murphy and Dorrien Van Dyke leading first-year players across the nation in scoring. This season, it looks like freshman Kylie Ohlmiller is picking up on the trend that the duo started, accounting for seven points in the Seawolves 13-6 win over Villanova.

“Kylie is an elite player,” Head Coach Joe Spallina said after the game. “There is nothing to hide there.”

It is not like Spallina has kept Ohlmiller’s talent a secret, either. Nobody was surprised when she took to a still snow-surrounded Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium and scored two goals while dishing five assists.

“I think Kylie Ohlmiller will be the most prolific scorer in the freshman class in the country,” Spallina said before Ohlmiller even stepped on the field for her first collegiate game. “Before she’s out of here she’ll be a very strong candidate to win the Tewaaraton, she’s that good.”

It takes a special player to win the Tewaaraton Award, given to the very best lacrosse player in the country. It means even more when such claims come from one of the most well known lacrosse coaches in the world.

“Coach is awesome. He says these things about a lot of girls,” Ohlmiller said humbly, before continuing. “It’s pretty nice to hear. He’s one of the top coaches in the country. It’s flattering.”

Against a Wildcats team that spent much of the game playing conservative defense in trying to limit any Stony Brook offense, Ohlmiller ended up with the ball in an awkward position and not much time to do something with it.

It was as if last season’s co-Tewaaraton Award winner on the men’s side, Miles Thompson, had taken the field. Without hesitating at all, Ohlmiller flipped the ball behind her back and past the Villanova goalie for what should have been a goal, but an iffy disallowance by the referees kept it off the board.

The thing is, that was not even the highlight of Ohlmiller’s game, as the West Islip, N.Y. native found four different teammates for goals.

“She makes the others around her better, which is the mark of a true superstar,” Spallina said about the young phenom. “I think she got more comfortable as the game went on.”

That holds true for Ohlmiller’s season as a whole, as she has steadily gotten more and more involved in the offense as she has gotten more comfortable. She found teammates for two assists in Stony Brook’s season opener against USC. She was also denied her first goal because of an illegal stick, but made up for it with her first collegiate goal and two assists against Drexel.

Michelle Rubino continued to display why Spallina and others have said that she is one of the best two-way midfielders not only in the America East Conference, but the entire nation. Flying at Villanova’s goalkeeper on one end to cause havoc on clear attempts and sprinting back to pressure the Wildcats offense, Rubino was simply everywhere at every moment.

If that was not enough, she scored three goals as well, bringing her total to five on the season heading into the team’s first major challenge of the year: facing nationally-ranked Notre Dame, a team that broke the Seawolves hearts last season in a 8-7 thriller. The Fighting Irish will greet the Seawolves on Long Island tomorow night.

“Our focus for us now shifts to Notre Dame Tuesday under the lights in our own barn,” Spallina said. “It’s a huge game on Long Island. It’s exciting.”

It will certainly be a test for a young team such as the Seawolves, one with senior leaders supplemented by underclassmen, who are all capable of putting the ball in the back of the net.

“The next couple of games we have, especially Notre Dame, they’re bigger teams,” Ohlmiller said, discussing the tougher schedule that is upcoming for the Seawolves. “They’re, you know, better. We’ve just got to keep going at practice, our practices, they’re tough. Like coach said, we don’t focus on anyone but ourselves.”

Nor will they have to, as Stony Brook looks to set the tone against the nationally-ranked Fighting Irish with its
pressuring defense. It will be up to Maegan Meritz and company to limit Notre Dame’s Cortney Fortunato, who scored four goals in the two team’s matchup last season.]]></content:encoded>

After beating Marist on the road, the Stony Brook men’s lacrosse team looked to finish off its road trip with a win against Rutgers. The Seawolves succeded, winning 13-9, and bringing their win streak to four games.

The first period looked like it was going to be a blowout for the Scarlet Knights. Sophomore attacked Christian Trasolini got on the board first for Rutgers, connecting on the assist from junior attacker Scott Bieda.

Trasolini scored once again jsut five minutes into the game, this time on an assist from senior midfielder Rich Rambo. Sophomore midfielder Jeff George also scored, getting his fifth goal of the year.

After the George goal, Stony Brook needed a spark. Mike Rooney scored off an assist by junior Challen Rogers. Rooney scored another just a minute after his first.

Junior midfielder Chris Hughes hit the equalizer, bringing the game to a 3-3 tie at the end of the first.

The Seawolves got on the board first in the second period after Hughes scored on an assist from sophomore midfielder Jeff Reh. Not to be outdone, the Scarlet Knights tied the game 4-4.

Stony Brook ended the period on a two goal run, the first coming from Rogers and the second by sophomore midfielder Alex Corpolongo on an assist by junior attacker Matt Schultz.

The third period was more of the same for the Seawolves. It started with another Rooney goal four minutes in, giving him his second hat trick of the season. The Seawolves continued adding on to their lead with goals by Corpolongo and Brody Eastwood. Eastwood scored an electrifying goal with a second left on an assist by Schultz, giving the Seawolves a 10-5 lead.

Rutgers responded early on in the fourth, when freshman midfielder Chad Toliver scored his seventh goal of the season. Soon after, Rooney extended the lead back to five with his fourth goal of the game. Brian Goss answered right back, scoring his second of the game.

Midfielder sophomore Ryan Bitzer then scored for the Seawolves. Rutgers answered SBU’s tally once again with another Trasolini goal, his fourth of the game. Junior attacker Ryan Hollingsworth also scored for the Scarlet Knights, giving him his second goal of the season off an assist by Bieda.

The game ended with another Rooney goal for the Seawolves, capping off a 13-9 victory for the team. Stony Brook’s next game will be this Saturday, when the Seawolves host Albany.]]></content:encoded>

The Stony Brook softball team traveled to Harrisonburg, V.A. this weekend to particpate in the JMU Invitational. The Seawolves played St. John’s, Maryland and James Madison University.

The Seawolves opened up the weekend with a Saturday morning matchup against St. John’s. Despite a strong rally, the Red Storm held on to beat Stony Brook 8-5.

St. John’s shortstop Monique Landini went 4-for-4 in the game and drove in
two runs.

The scoring started early with a three-run first inning for the Red Storm on RBI singles by Landini and Yvonne Rericha.

Stony Brook answered in the bottom of the first as Shayla Giosia showed her power and knocked a solo homer to left center. St. John’s plated three more in the top of the second, making the score 6-1. However the Seawolves would not give up, scoring two more runs of their own in the bottom of the inning.

Going into the bottom of the fourth, the Red Storm led the Seawolves 7-3. Melissa Phelan led off the inning with a solo home run down the left field line, and Kellie Reynolds drove Patty Borges home with an RBI double to left, closing the gap to 7-5.

But, St. John’s put the nail in the coffin off the bat of an RBI double by Brittany Garcia in the top of the fifth. Jane Sallen started on the mound for Stony Brook and was credited with the loss, giving up six runs on seven hits, walking two and
fanning three.

The second game of the tournament was much closer as the Seawolves fell to Maryland, 2-1. It was a pitchers’ duel from the start. The Terrapins got on the board early as Erin Pronobis hit an RBI double to left center, sending Corey Schwartz home in the top of the first. Maryland scored again in the second inning as Sallen walked Hannah Dewey with the bases loaded, forcing Shannon Bustillos home.

The Seawolves scored their lone run of the game on a solo home run by Kim Ragazzo in the bottom of the third inning.

Sallen took the mound once again for Stony Brook and pitched a strong complete game against Maryland. She allowed two runs on five hits, three walks, and six strikeouts.

Kaitlyn Schmeiser started for the Terrapins, getting her 11th win after pitching seven innings. She gave up one run, five hits, walked two, and fanned seven.

SBU closed out the tournament with a dramatic 6-4 comeback against James Madison, overcoming a four-run deficit in the top of the seventh inning. The Dukes scored in the bottom of the first on a three-run homer off the bat of Megan Good, plating Erica Field and Niki Prince. They extended their lead in the bottom of the fifth as Prince lined a double into left and sent Tahli Moore home, making the score 4-0.

Stony Brook finally got on the board in the top of the sixth on a sac fly by Phelan. The Seawolves scored again on a wild pitch, closing the gap to 4-2.

A seventh-inning rally gave Stony Brook a 6-4 lead heading into the bottom of the seventh. The Seawolves were able to close out the game after allowing a two-out single in the seventh inning.

Allison Cukrov got her first win of the season, pitching a complete game. She gave up four runs on six hits, walked one and struck out an impressive eight batters.

Jailyn Ford hurled seven innings as well, allowing six runs on nine hits, one walk and eight strikeouts.

The Seawolves will travel to Teaneck, N.J. to play a doubleheader Fairleigh Dickinson this Wednesday. The games start at 4 p.m. and 6 p.m.]]></content:encoded>

After the Stony Brook women’s basketball team went all the way from four to 14 to 24 wins in only three seasons, there was unlimited room for optimism. Over the offseason, they lost their Head Coach Beth O’Boyle to Virginia Commonwealth. Caroline McCombs took over and brought a fresh mind and staff with the goal of leading the Seawolves to their first America East Championship.

The team hit its bumps here and there, but when it mattered most, SBU found themselves in nearly the same spot that they did last year. McCombs and company ended the 30-game road winning streak in conference held by Albany with a second half-performance that rivaled any by the team this season.

To be quite frank, the Seawolves needed to get hot. Halfway into America East play, Stony Brook was 4-4 in the conference. Last season, the team only lost three times against the same eight teams all season long. It was not only about the standings, but getting into prime form for March, the games that matter most.

Winning six of seven games will do that for a team, and that is exactly what the Seawolves accomplished. In the second half of Stony Brook’s core season, the Seawolves were not so far from running the table. A loss to the top team in the conference, Maine, and a heartbreaker at Hartford left the team at 10-6 in America East play, controlling the No. 3 slot going into the tournament.

In some ways, the Seawolves could not have asked for anything more in preparation for another run towards the light at the end of the tunnel in the form of an America East Championship.

They had a quarterfinal matchup against the UMBC Retrievers, a team they had beaten by a combined 49 points in their two meetings this year. Next on the list would more than likely be a clash with second-seeded Albany and its superstar, one of the best mid-major players in the country, Shereesha Richards, who they just beat.

The thing is, they did not get to that point. Instead, they were shocked by a team that had nothing to lose in UMBC.

Taking 25 three-point shots, nearly half of the team’s total shot attempts in the game, was something that the Seawolves at points lived by, but eventually died from.

Going five for 25 from deep on the game, while shooting two out of 15 from long range in the first half, the Seawolves simply could not find a rhythm from the outside against a zone played by the Retrievers. A couple of key threes from sophomore Kori Bayne-Walker kept the Seawolves within striking range when it seemed as if things could fall apart, but that was not what led a furious comeback.

Bayne-Walker came off of the bench last season as a spark of energy game in and game out driving to the hole and drawing fouls, finishing many tough shots.

In a starting role this year, Bayne-Walker showed once again that her drive into the paint is the most reliable aspect of the Seawolves offense. Down 10 in the second half, she took over by doing just that and with time ticking down, she once again got to the hoop and after grabbing her own offensive rebound and tied the game.

Stony Brook went onto lose the game, a disappointing result without a doubt, but the Seawolves saw what can be a future for the team. That future can very possibly revolve around the offensive talent of Bayne-Walker.

As senior Sabre Proctor, who walked off the court on crutches due to a knee injury at the end of the first half against UMBC, and classmate Jessica Ogunnorin move on, Stony Brook will need a new top scorer and first option.

A loss is a loss, there is no way around it. However, UMBC forcing the Seawolves against the wall may have shown McCombs that Bayne-Walker is ready to take on a starring role for the team.]]></content:encoded>

Last Monday, the America East conference announced its 2014-2015 honors for men’s basketball. Three Seawolves were awarded for their play this season.

Forward Jameel Warney headlined the announcement. The junior from Plainfield, N.J. was named America East Player of the Year, averaging 16.2 points and 11.5 rebounds per game. Warney, who averaged a double-double per game, recorded his conference-leading 22nd of the season during Sunday’s semifinal playoff victory versus No. 2 Vermont.

Warney was the conference leader in points, rebounds and also blocks, being named the America East Defensive Player of the Year. A force defensively all season, Warney was placed on the conference All-Defensive Team.

Warney was joined by his teammate Carson Puriefoy, who also recieved First-Team honors. The junior guard from Wenonah, N.J. averaged 13.9 points and 3.4 assists per game, the second highest mark in the America East.

Puriefoy’s success on the court was indicative of the outcome of the Seawolves’ games. Stony Brook was 18-5 this season when Puriefoy recorded double digit points, surpassing the 20-point mark six times. On Jan. 25, Puriefoy dropped a career-high 27 points to propel the Seawolves to victory over Binghamton.

Rayshaun McGrew was the last Seawolf to be honored on Monday, being named to the America East Third-Team. McGrew, a junior forward from Chicago, started in all 32 regular season games averaging 8.7 points and 8.3 rebounds. He took advantage of the opportunity to be a starter after coming off the bench in 29 games during the 2013-2014 season.

Warney, Puriefoy and McGrew will look to continue their hot play through the end of the America East conference tournament and beyond. The Seawolves are prepared to play No. 1 seeded Albany this Saturday, with a chance to dance on the line.]]></content:encoded>

It was not quite “The Miracle on Ice,” but to call Stony Brook’s comeback on Sunday evening against the Robert Morris University-Illinois Eagles anything but miraculous would be a punitive understatement.

Trailing 4-3 with 30 seconds remaining in regulation, and their season hanging in the balance, the Seawolves struck. Then, when overtime seemed certain—a victory within itself—magic was in the air as the puck found the back of the net once again, propelling the Seawolves to their second-consecutive Final Four appearance.

Senior forward Nick Barbera was clearly not ready to head back to Long Island, as he netted the game-tying goal on a dish from sophomore JT Hall with 30 seconds to play. No one would have blamed the Seawolves for sitting on the puck the remaining half a minute and letting the game come down to a dramatic overtime period, but conservative is not a word in these Seawolves’ vocabulary.

With just six seconds remaining in regulation, senior Vincent Lopes scored the biggest goal of his career. Lopes put home a rebound that guaranteed the continuation of what now seems to be a date with destiny—and the Arizona State Sun Devils.

Only three teams topped the Seawolves during the 2014-15 season—one of which was the Sun Devils. ASU will be without star goaltender Robert Levin, who is out due to a torn ACL, as the Seawolves are looking for the upset over the undisputed number one team in the nation.

The game is a rematch of last season’s National Championship game where the Sun Devils were just a single goal better, emerging as the 4-3 victors that sent the Seawolves home heartbroken. Although ASU has come out on the winning end twice in the three matchups between the teams this year, payback looms for a Stony Brook club that surely has not forgotten last March.

With a win on Monday night at 5 p.m., the Seawolves may not secure themselves a National Championship (which would take place Tuesday at 7 p.m.), but it will exorcise the demons the Devils created a year ago. And now, they are just 60 minutes away from playing for their second consecutive National Title. This time, they do not intend to come back empty-handed.]]></content:encoded>

Senior Sabre Proctor was selected to the America East first team for the second consecutive season, as the Seawolves received six conference awards. Sophomore Kori Bayne-Walker was named to the second team, as she led the league in assists with 5.4 per game.

KRYSTEN MASSA / THE STATESMAN" width="600" height="400" /></a> Crazy Beans in the Stony Brook Village center was established in May of 2014. <em>KRYSTEN MASSA / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

The Stony Brook area is home to a variety of locally-owned food places that students may not know about if they do not leave campus often for meals. Crazy Beans in Stony Brook Village and Tiger Lily Café in Port Jefferson are two examples of such places. Both offer unique menu items and atmospheres.

<b>Crazy Beans (Stony Brook)</b>

This small café in Stony Brook Village has a welcoming and inviting atmosphere. The inside is decorated with red-and-white checkered floors and retro booths. Every table even has its own specially-themed, themed salt and pepper shakers. One booth features a motorcycle-couple set of shakers.

A unique touch is that the café iced drinks are served in mason jars. Manager Kevin Coleman said that Crazy Beans’ iced chocolate peanut butter latte is a fan favorite.

For those who want a hot drink, Crazy Beans’ serves them in a different decorative mug every time.

“My favorite part about working at Crazy Beans is the other people who work here,” Coleman said. “We are like a family.”

The café has 30 latte flavors to choose from, including the apple pie latte, toasted marshmallow latte, dark chocolate latte and a spiced brown sugar latte. On top of that, they have 18 flavors of tea. Flavors include orange spice, chamomile and bombay chai.

The menu offers everything from the Head Honcho (grilled steak, bell peppers, mushrooms, frazzled onions, cheddar, southwest ranch on a rustic roll) to the Pancake Quesadilla—scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, cheddar and Vermont maple syrup.

“People come in for the atmosphere, good food and friendly people,” Coleman said.

<b>Tiger Lily Café (Port Jefferson)</b>

Tiger Lily Café  is known for its vegetarian options, but serves much more than that. The menu is divided between vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes to make it easier for those with dietary restrictions to view the menu.

“I love working at Tiger Lily Café  because of the good energy and great food,” Kelly Connoly, café manager, said. “It’s artsy and fun.”

The mosaic tables give the place a hip feel. Customers also have a lot of variety to choose from when it comes to the drink menu. The menu has regular coffee, like the Mocha Java, which is the house blend. It also has specialty drinks like the Mocha Blanca, a white chocolate drink. Frozen Frappes are also available, with 10 flavors to pick from.

Tiger Lily Café  offers quite an extensive juice and smoothie menu. The café has fresh squeezed juices, fresh squeezed cocktails, fruit smoothies, soy smoothies and soy protein energy shakes.

“There are so many customer favorites, I don’t even know where to begin,” Connoly said. “They love our sunshine burgers, protein shakes and juices.”]]></content:encoded>

An audience settled into the Student Activities Center Auditorium on Wednesday to see a staged reading of a nearly 2,500-year-old Greek tragedy, Sophocles’ “Ajax.”

Reg E. Cathey (“The Wire,” “House of Cards”) played Ajax, a soldier who fought in the mythical war on Troy, and Martha Plimpton (“The Good Wife,” “Raising Hope”) played his wife, Tecmessa.

The reading and the following discussion was directed by Bryan Doerries, who also created the translation used.

Doerries is the founder of Theater of War and the larger performance company it is a part of, Outside The Wire.

Outside The Wire was brought to campus in part through the efforts of Professor Roger Thompson. Thompson applied for one of Stony Brook’s Presidential Mini-Grants for Departmental Diversity Initiatives, which helped fund the performance.

Theater of War’s goal with this program was to facilitate discourse between active soldiers, veterans, families, caregivers and other citizens. To do this, the group uses selections from ancient plays as material and inspiration for discussion.

According to Outside The Wire’s website, this is because these ancient plays timelessly and universally depict the visible and invisible wounds inflicted upon warriors by war.

Theater Of War’s Facebook page states, “By presenting these plays to military audiences, our hope is to de-stigmatize psychological injury and open a safe space for dialogue.”

The play begins near the end of the Trojan War, after Ajax had lost family members and friends and had been slighted by his own generals.

He is filled with an uncontrollable rage, and Tecmessa and his soldiers struggle to help him. He wanders to a deserted beach and kills himself with a sword through his stomach.

Once the performance was over, four people who had volunteered before the show stepped up to the stage.

They all had personal experience with war and its damage. One was a trauma counselor, another a wife to a veteran and two were veterans themselves. The four people on stage touched on lines that had resonated with them.

Ajax says wrathfully “Crying is for women and cowards” and “Silence becomes a woman.”

These themes were consistent in the comments: that overseas there is often not an outlet for grief, and that upon returning home communication is difficult between a soldier and their spouse.

The conclusion was the same for everyone on stage: finding ways to develop communication and understanding helped. Some used group therapy, others counseling, and others veterans’ associations for support.

Doerries then posed questions to the group on stage and the audience: “What do you think Sophocles was doing by staging this play?” he asked.

He said that, to his surprise, soldiers have told him that they think it was to boost the moral of Sophocles’ troops. It is moral boosting “because it’s the truth,” they said.

Doerries then asked the Stony Brook audience: “If Ajax were someone you know, what would you say or do?”

One of the veterans present answered, in response to Ajax going to commit suicide: “I would tell him: ‘Sure, I’ll go to the beach with you. I’ll bring my sword, too. We’ll both do it.’ And then I’d say, ‘But let’s just do it tomorrow.’ And then I’d say that too him every day” in order to give him time.

The event was well done as both a facilitated community discussion and a type of theater. Plimpton and Cathey both delivered exceptional performances with difficult roles.

They were playing people experiencing things far beyond the normal range of human emotion, yet entirely real.

By necessity of the scene they had to shout and rage and cry, and yet the performances never became melodramatic or bombastic.

It felt merely like watching a friend go through the bleakest suffering and not knowing how to help them.

Additionally, Ajax was written by someone who understands: Sophocles was a playwright and also a soldier in a time of war.

For civilians with no connection to the military, the performance bestows understanding and empathy.

Doerries said that in response to his first question—what was Sophocles doing by staging this tragedy?—a general who attended one of the early performances answered “I think Sophocles wrote the play to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.

Outside the Wire’s next stop for “Theatre of War” will in April in Anchorage, Alaska.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Students bring classical Indian dance to SB with Taandava</title>

There is an Indian saying, “The goddess of learning and the arts will not smile upon you unless you remember the contributions of your elders.”

Stony Brook’s Taandava Indian dance team had the crowd, along with the goddess, smiling as they performed classical dances for a cause this Saturday at the Charles B. Wang Center.

“Jana Seva,” meaning “humanism,” was apparent, as donations from the night supported Stony Brook’s Camp Kesem and Ozanam Bhavan.

Camp Kesem provides a free week-long summer camp for children with parents who have or have had cancer. Ozanam Bhavan is an organization that cares for the homeless, sick and mentally ill in India.

Justin Tamjit, volunteer of development for Camp Kesem, said, “We set up fun events throughout the year so people can come support us. We hope to expand Camp Kesem and make it a household name for students. It’s [the camp] a way for me to outlet, I have had family members that passed away from cancer and this is my way of giving back.”

The ancient South Asian Taandava dance style originates from the Hindu god Shiva and is usually performed in temples, but had a full house of family and friends flooding the Wang Center to see this young dance group perform.

The night opened with the “Ganesha Kavuthuvam” dance, a vibrant and colorful ode to Ganesha, the remover of obstacles. The night followed with six more impressive compositions. The fluid steps were intertwined with rigorous movements in singular and group dancing.

The golds, reds, greens and purples drew the audience into the stories of the dances. The love and passion of the culture glowed from the stage as the dancers depicted this art form.

Stony Brook students Saroja Kolluru and Natalie Poonam Phagu founded the team in 2013. This is Stony Brook’s first-ever Indian classical dance team.

The team’s first-ever performance for a National Society of Collegiate Scholars event was two years ago.

Since then, the team has grown in numbers and reputation. Now, the group has 16 members. They  will be performing in various colleges throughout the state, like St. Johns and Queens College.

What is unique about Stony Brook Taandava is its desire to keep to tradition.

Unlike many other cultural dance groups, Taandava does not wish to infuse any modern pop aesthetics into the mix of its classic Indian choreography.

In a speech after the show, Dr. S.N. Sridhar, professor of Linguistics and India Studies Director of the Center for India Studies said, “This (the dance) is a composite art form that combines poetry music dance drama as well as religion and spirituality.”

Co-founder and Vice President Phagu says that in order to pull off such an organized ensemble the team can practice five hours a day at times and over ten hours a week on average.

Phagu says that the team hopes to perform the “Jana Seva” event every year and expose the group to other schools as well.

The recent opening of a Taandava chapter in Queens College gives Stony Brook Taandava an opportunity to make more appearances in more venues.

Dedication to the dance and commitment to the culture drives the success of this group.

From an early start, Taandava plans to keep to tradition as new members join.

Twenty years from now, the group wants to maintain the legacy alive and resemble the same familiar concept of Indian classical dance.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_36884" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-36884 size-medium" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/internetTsirka-Stella_036F-600x400.jpg" alt="PHOTO CREDIT: STONYBROOK.EDU" width="600" height="400" /> SBU Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs Stella Tsirka, pictured above, said the university's first priority is to create support groups for underrepresented faculty and students, with the second step being to recruit more minority professors. <em>PHOTO CREDIT: STONYBROOK.EDU</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1">The SUNY Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion recently announced a Faculty Diversity Program to provide partial salary support to SUNY campuses for academics who belong to the groups that have been historically underrepresented in higher education.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Faculty Diversity Program is structured in a way to provide state-operated campuses with a percentage of the faculty member’s salary for three years. It is highly competitive, providing up to $145,000 total for each appointed faculty member.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">"People need mentors and role models, and I think we need to do a better job of recruiting people of color and underrepresented minorities into faculty and staff positions,” Stony Brook University President Samuel L. Stanley Jr. said at a Feb. 18 roundtable with campus media.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SBU is determined to increase the number of faculty from underrepresented minorities. However, the pool of potential applicants is limited. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of the 752,000 U.S. doctorate degrees in science, engineering and health fields earned in 2008, under 3 percent went to African Americans and less than 3 percent went to Hispanics, according to National Science Foundation data. Such small numbers force universities to fiercely compete for the handful of minority candidates.</span></p>
<p class="p1">“We want to increase the diversity of our faculty, but we don’t want to compromise the scholars,” SBU Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs Stella Tsirka said. “We can accomplish both with increasing the targeting of our ads as opposed to lowering our expectations.”</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stony Brook University has recently introduced a new Talent Management System that uses sophisticated software to automate recruitment, onboarding and management. The TMS could potentially help in increasing diversity and in allowing officials to monitor searches that are going on for faculty.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I think those things will help us because it will make it easier for me to hold people accountable for how they're </span>doing their hiring,” Stanley said.</p>
“My first sense is that our immediate focus will be on creating communities and creating support system for faculty that is already here,” Tsirka said. “And second would be to continue with recruitment. I don’t know how much hiring will we do here to target potential diversity faculty, but first we have to make sure we take care of the faculty that are here.”

“We do feel that professors with different points of view and background add a lot to the college experience and we are working to expand this,” Elizabeth G. Carrature, associate for research and development at the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, said.

The chief academic officers at a college nominate a candidate. This year’s submissions were due in mid-February.

“All the applications are reviewed before awards are made to a few select candidates,” Carrature said. “We have to be conscious in our selection and choose candidates among colleges that have not yet received any rewards.”

At Stony Brook University, there is still a lot more diversity in the student population than in the faculty. Specific programs like Africana Studies have more than 90 percent African-American faculty, but a lot of other programs have very few or even none, Tsirka said.

Tsirka said that diversity is extremely important because it “brings different experiences to the campus and different kind of culture.” It also makes campus much more “encompassing, much more open and accepting of other people,” she said.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>SUNY 2020&#039;s rational tuition expiration causing concern at Stony Brook</title>

Stanley Jr., above, is a supporter of the limits on tuition increases offered through SUNY 2020. <em>STATESMAN STOCK PHOTO</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s SUNY 2020 legislation is set to expire at the next academic year’s end, and with it goes a built-in program for predictable tuition costs that Stony Brook University’s Undergraduate Student Government, faculty and administration are working to save.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Called rational tuition, the plan was passed in 2011 to give New York’s state and city universities a way to raise tuition by up to $300 each year for five years for in-state undergraduate students and up to 10 percent each year for five years for out-of-state undergraduate students.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Before we had SUNY 2020, it was tuition roulette,” SBU President Samuel L. Stanley Jr. said in a meeting with campus media. “Some years there would be massive tuition increases—20 to 30 percent in a year—and other years, there would be nothing.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A presentation prepared by SUNY Associate Vice Chancellor for Government Relations Stacey B. Hengsterman shows tuition was raised at some institutions by as much as $950 in a year, a fact that influenced Norman Goodman, a professor and Stony Brook University senator, to favor SUNY 2020 since its inception.</span></p>
<p class="p1">“The rational tuition policy is a reasonable approach to tuition,” he said in an interview. He continued, expressing his opinion that students deserve a free, quality education—preferably achieved for free—but that rational tuition is the next-best alternative.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A list of Stony Brook-specific SUNY 2020 talking points shows that due to the legislation, Stony Brook improved the student-to-faculty ratio to about 25:1, $3.2 million in grants were awarded to over 9,600 students and 19 new degree and advanced certificate programs were offered.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Both Stanley and Undergraduate Student Government Vice President of Academic Affairs Steven Adelson said extending SUNY 2020’s expiration would mean prospective students of New York’s public institutions would be able to compare and plan for future education costs, and the value of a Stony Brook degree would continue to rise while SBU would be able to continue to hire more faculty.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Adelson cautioned, though, that if the legislation was not renewed, preferably before it expired, the state funding Stony Brook currently receives could be put in jeopardy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At its Feb. 23 senate meeting, Stony Brook University’s USG became the first SUNY student government to pass a resolution in favor of extending SUNY 2020’s deadline. The resolution calls for Cuomo and the NYS legislature to renew SUNY 2020 and encourages all SUNY student governing bodies to pass a similar legislation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Four years ago, when rational tuition and SUNY 2020 was a conversation, it started with students,” Adelson said. “The idea is that once a</span>gain, it should start with students.” In April, he will be presenting this resolution to the SUNY Student Assembly, a conference for student leaders from all 64 <span style="line-height: 1.5;">SUNY campuses. </span></p>
“Obviously no one wants to have to pay more for anything—that’s just a general rule,” Adelson, who wrote the resolution, said. “But as a student, when you know there is no way your tuition will increase over the course of your four years by more than $1200, I think that’s fantastic.”

He did say that if SUNY 2020 is extended and Stony Brook looks to increase its tuition year after year, he thinks SBU’s administration should be more ardent about educating students as to what the increases will go toward, as there is a history of student discontent with fee increases of any type.

“We shouldn’t dictate what these tuition increases will be as students when we’re not knowledgeable about why the tuition increases are coming about,” Adelson said. “But it should be on the administrative end to [educate students], to be proactive rather than having student disapproval of fee increases.”]]></content:encoded>

On Sunday afternoon, the Stony Brook baseball team opened the home portion of its 2015 schedule with a doubleheader against the Fordham Rams (2-9), which was “off-limits” to the public due to hazardous conditions surrounding the field.

The Seawolves would go on to take the opening contest by a final score of 6-1 before dropping the back-end of the doubleheader, 9-6.

In the first game of the doubleheader, the Seawolves cruised to a 6-1 victory over the Rams on the back of their ace, Tyler Honahan. The left-hander would toss six innings of three-hit, one-run ball en route to his second victory of the year.

The Rams struck first in the top of the third inning, but the Seawolves’ bats would awake almost immediately. Senior second baseman Robert Chavarria delivered with the bases loaded in the bottom half of the frame, knocking in two runners with a hit to the opposite field.

Also driving in a run in the third with a base hit was senior catcher Cole Peragine, who finished the first game going 3-for-4.

With 11 hits in total, eight of the nine Seawolves in the starting lineup got a knock. The lone man not to—sophomore outfielder Casey Baker—contributed with a sacrifice fly in the bottom of the eighth, giving Stony Brook its sixth and final run.

Slamming the door for Stony Brook in the opener was junior right-hander Tim Knesnik. In three innings of work, he struck out four and allowed three hits, retiring nine of the last 10 batters he faced.

For as lights out as the pitching was in the early game, it was all the more porous the second time around. Getting the start was sophomore right-hander Ryley MacEachern, who, after allowing two runs on two walks and two hits in the first inning, would not return to the mound.

The deuce the Rams put up in the first inning was quickly erased by junior outfielder Jack Parenty, who knotted the game back up at two with a two-out, bases loaded, two-RBI single in the bottom of the second. Parenty would finish the second contest 4-for-5 with three RBIs to go along with his hit in the opener, giving him a 5-for-9 afternoon in total.

Serving the role of long man in the bullpen, sophomore left-hander Daniel Zamora tossed 4.2 innings of work, while allowing seven hits, six runs (five of which were earned) and two walks, while striking out three.

Coming off a multi-hit performance his last time out, freshman Malcolm Nachmanoff had another banner afternoon, driving in a run and reaching base three of his four <span style="line-height: 1.5;">times to the plate. </span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">The Seawolves would rally for three runs in the bottom half of the ninth, but ultimately fall short in the end. </span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Next up for SBU will be a doubleheader on Saturday March 14, at home against Binghamton.</span>]]></content:encoded>

When it comes to making sure a once-in-a-lifetime trip across the Atlantic Ocean is as memorable as possible, sometimes one is willing to go to extremes. For Chris Joseph, it was his second time, but he was still trying to get the perfect shot when taking photographs on a cliff during his time in Spain.

“We climbed the fence and went to the edge of the cliff and took a ton of pictures looking out into the ocean,” the second-year World University Games Team USA player said. “The wind was so strong, I almost lost my backpack twice.”

He and fellow senior Sam Brewster were the two Stony Brook hockey players named to Team USA for the World University Games in Granada, Spain.

“Initially we got treated like professionals,” Brewster recalled. “To play in front of 8,000 people against the home country of Spain…it’s surreal.”

Joseph specifically recalled the quarterfinal matchup against Canada in which team USA skated out to the same number of people chanting “USA, USA, USA.” Sound familiar?

“It reminded me of the movie 'Miracle,'” Joseph said. “When we played Canada, the place was packed and everybody was chanting USA. Everybody wanted us to win.”

The movie that portrays the USA’s 1980 hockey victory over the Soviet Union was being re-enacted right before their very eyes, and it left quite the impression. However, there was no Kurt Russell speech in the locker room.

“I can only imagine what it felt like after [the 1980 Olympic team] won that game,” Joseph said.

Even though this was not the Olympic Games and NBC was not everywhere, the sparkle of playing for Team USA did not change.

“I don’t know if there’s more of a peak than putting on a USA jersey,” Brewster said. “To get your name on the back of a Team USA jersey, there’s nothing better than it in the world.”

Even without the speech, or the times for that matter, the level of competition they were facing made it a comparable situation. Canada had six NHL draftees on their roster, with three players already having NHL entry-level contracts. With Russia and Kazakhstan also acting professional, there was a tall task ahead for these Seawolves and their Team USA teammates.

“The effort was expected.” Brewster said. “You had to go full tilt, 100 percent of the time, or it will be blatantly obvious that you aren’t.” However, the expectations of success were still there. “It became a point of emphasis to be successful against those teams,” Brewster added.

Team USA defeated the Kazakhstanians 3-2 in a shootout, but was not able to do the same against the Canadians, losing 4-0 in the quarterfinal bout. The Americans finished seventh in this year’s edition, worse than the first time that Joseph went with another senior on the Seawolves hockey roster, Ryan Cotcamp.

“Our team was more skilled this year, but we drew a harder card going into the quarters,” Joseph said. Joseph also added that going with Cotcamp in 2013 made things easier, but this year with Brewster, it was not the same feeling. “I was more relaxed,” he said.

With seven returning players, it also made the experience off the ice even better. But the language barrier? Not so much.

“Cafe con leche [coffee with milk] was all I knew,” Brewster said with a laugh. “I played in Germany and Sweden a couple summers. They at least spoke a little English.”

Joseph was not having too much luck with communicating with the locals either. “I took Spanish here last semester and it didn’t really help me too much,” he said while laughing as well. “I thought they were talking a thousand miles an hour.”

There was one place that was visited where communicating with the locals was not necessary to have a good time: the Mediterranean Sea.

“We got to be goofballs down there for a couple days,” Brewster said. For this forward-defenseman tandem, the season is not over. “We knew that as soon as that was over that we had to get ready,” Joseph said. The Seawolves had the ESCHL tournament one week ahead of them and then the ACHA Division I tournament just a week later.

The Seawolves took their conference, and are off to a good start in the national tournament, moving into the quarterfinals after a 1-0 victory over Rhode Island.

“It’s time to get back at it and bring home a national championship,” Joseph said.

Whether it was almost falling off a cliff or relaxing on the beach, there were many memorable occasions across the ocean that will forever be stamped on their senior season.

“You work your whole life to play a game,” Brewster said, putting it into perspective nicely. “When you work so hard for something and you get a chance to show it, really remember it and take it in and suck it up for all it’s worth because you don’t get a lot of those chances in life.”]]></content:encoded>

James College hosted a film screening and discussion on the Free The Nipple campaign Friday night to help make students aware of global censorship and oppression women are facing today.

Around 25 students, almost equally male and female, gathered in James in H Quad at 8 p.m. for the event.

The event coordinator, Teresa Tagliaferri, resident assistant at James College, said she was “hoping to receive an even mix of men and women, but it’s possible that there may be more women than men.”

“Free the Nipple” is not just a film, but an equality movement and operation to empower women, stand against global censorship and dismantle oppression worldwide.

It is illegal for women to go topless in 35 states, breastfeed in public or expose a nipple. Men, however, are allowed to walk around topless without legal repercussions.

The 1992 court decision People v. Santorelli declared that banning bare female breasts in public violates equal protection clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions.

Though New York legalized public-toplessness for women over two decades ago, women still get arrested for exposing their breasts in public.

Free the Nipple is supported worldwide and by celebrities as well. Miley Cyrus, Rihanna, Chelsea Handler, Jennifer Lopez and Madonna are a few advocates of the movement.

The celebs have shown their support for the campaign on their social media accounts and have flashed their own nipples at red carpet events.

“This event [Free the Nipple screening and discussion] is part of F-Word and Gender Equality Week, which is taking place now. It is a large collaboration of events and programs focused on discussing past and present gender issues in society in honor of Women’s History Month,” Tagliaferri said.

Tagliaferri had been planning this event for a few months now.

“I first watched this movie over winter break and knew right away that I wanted to host a program about it this semester. I started brainstorming a bit then, but the more in-depth planning process didn’t happen until the semester began,” she said.

The event began with a group discussion to put the film into context before it started.

Tagliaferri asked the audience to write down three reasons they thought female breasts are looked at differently than a males and to then discuss these reasons with a neighboring individual.

The group called out reasons like “female breasts are seen as sexual organs” or “private parts,” “female breasts usually hold more fat than a males does, making them look better,” “they are seen as a distraction to some males” and “bras hide breasts, almost making them seem like hidden objects.”

Once the group’s reasons were discussed, the film commenced.

There was laughter during a few entertaining scenes and there were moments of reverence and deep silence as the group took in some of the powerful ideas of the film—inequality, sexism and freedom.

Tagliaferri had put together a list of talking points to guide the post-film discussion, but she said that she expected that the residents would have plenty of great ideas to contribute after watching the film, and they did.

“I thought it was really great that the discussions were before and after the film. I think that was smart planning and I think it really helped us to think about the movie afterwards—we didn’t just leave, we sat there in that moment and talked,” Rachel Cocca, a freshman political science and theatre double major, said.

“This was really informative. ‘Free The Nipple’ and all about this double standard that men can be topless and women can’t. It was this whole different idea that I never really thought about. I never thought that it was controversial and I was really surprised that it was such a big deal. It really got me thinking,” Jamella Chesney, a junior chemistry major, said.

A male’s perspective on the event was not much different than that of the females.

“I thought it was very good movie. It definitely proved the point that there should not be a double standard and there should not be inequality in this situation. I thought it was a very effective movie and event,” Robert Maida, a junior business management and sustainability studies double major, said.

Tagliaferri said she received support from fellow committee members, staff for the F-Word and Gender Equality week as well as her staff members and supervisor.

“It was great to receive suggestions and feedback from them,” she said.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Stony Brook club hockey team was one game away from history in Cleveland, Ohio Tuesday night. But when the team needed it most, the offense was nowhere to be found as the Central Oklahoma Bronchos defeated the Seawolves 4-0 in the American Collegiate Hockey Association Men’s Division I Final.

It was Stony Brook’s first appearance in a National Championship game since the 2002-2003 season and the Seawolves first ever national title game at the Division I level. The loss put an end to SBU’s 11-game winning streak.

After a scoreless first period, it was all Bronchos, as they scored a pair in the second and third periods en route to the victory.

Ryan Duley and Josh Wyatt scored 82 seconds apart in the second period to give Central Oklahoma a lead it would not relinquish. Duley struck after being set up by assists from Tyler Minx and Matt Prigge to make it 1-0, and then Wyatt lit the lamp on the power play at the 7:31 mark after Nolan Grauer found him with a pass. It was Vinny Lopes’ slashing penalty that gave the Bronchos the man advantage.

In the third it was more of the same, as Trevor Yee was able to record two assists in the period to put the game out of reach. First, he set up Michael Rivera at the 4:41 mark to give UCO a 3-0 lead. Then, Wyatt finished the scoring with an empty netter after getting a pass from Yee.

After stopping 11 shots in the first period, Stony Brook goalie Brendan Jones allowed four goals on only 12 shots in the next two periods. It was something the Seawolves had not seen from Jones this tournament, as he stopped 32 shots against Rhode Island in a shutout effort and then stopped 39 of 40 shots in the Seawolves’ upset 2-1 win over the top-seeded Arizona State Sun Devils Monday night.

Stony Brook’s matchup with ASU featured two scoreless periods between before the Seawolves struck twice within a 13-second span and then held on for dear life.

Nick Barbera was able to slap home a shot off a feed from Lopes at the 4:07 mark of the third, and then it was JT Hall slotting home the game-winning goal at the 4:20 mark.

Edward McGovern took advantage of a Kevin Kavanaugh boarding penalty to cut the lead to 2-1, but the Sun Devils were not able to score in the final 10:38 of the game, allowing the Seawolves to enter the title game with Central Oklahoma.

The Seawolves finished the season 33-6. The team will have to do some rebuilding over this offseason if the Seawolves hope to make it back to next year’s national tournament. Stony Brook will be losing several key seniors this spring, including Lopes, Barbera, Sam Brewster, Jones, Ryan Cotcamp and Chris Joseph.]]></content:encoded>

The executive of a bank and a hotel who also works as a lawyer was arrested at Stony Brook University on a forcible touching charge last week, according to court records.

John C. Tsunis, the board chairman CEO of Gold Coast Bank, was arrested by University Police on March 4 at 8:41 p.m. at Island Federal Credit Union Arena, during the time of the <a href="http://sbstatesman.com/2015/03/04/warneys-double-double-propels-seawolves-past-bearcats/">men’s basketball game against Binghamton University</a>.

Tsunis, 63, is also a partner in the law firm Tsunis Gasparis Lustig Ring and Kenney LLP and the chairman and CEO of Long Island Hotels LLC.

He has served as chairman of the Stony Brook Long Island Children’s Hospital Task Force, chairman of the board of trustees of the Long Island Museum in Stony Brook and former president of the Three Village Chamber of Commerce.

At the time of publication, the court records did not list an attorney for Tsunis. The Poquott resident is scheduled for arraignment on April 30 at Suffolk First District Court.

New York Penal Law Article 130.52 states: “A person is guilty of forcible touching when such person intentionally, and for no legitimate purpose, forcibly touches the sexual or other intimate parts of another person for the purpose of degrading or abusing such person; or for the purpose of gratifying the actor's sexual desire. For the purposes of this section, forcible touching includes squeezing, grabbing or pinching. Forcible touching is a class A misdemeanor.”]]></content:encoded>

The Center for the Study of Men and Masculinities at Stony Brook University held its inaugural conference on masculinity from March 5 to 8 at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City.

The International Conference on Masculinities: Engaging Men and Boys for Gender Equality was held in the wake of the second MenEngage Global Symposium in New Delhi last November and before the UN Commission on Status of Women, which takes place on Monday.

“A lot of important international activists will be in town for the UN Commission so we figured if we held the conference this weekend we’d have a chance for them to attend this as well,” Cliff Leek, co-program director at the center and Ph.D. candidate in sociology at Stony Brook, said.

As a result, 600 scholars, educators and gender equality activists—including 120 presenters and panelists—from around the globe gathered in New York for the four-day symposium.

According to Michael Kimmel, executive director of the Center for the Study of Men and Masculinities at Stony Brook University, about 120 guests and speakers were not able to attend the conference due to weather.

However, the ones who did show up included prominent female figures and activists such as actress Jane Fonda; Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook; and Gloria Steinem, one of the leaders of the early feminist movement in the United States.

According to Leek, the goal of the conference is to bring researchers and activists together to discuss ways to promote and improve gender justice and equality.

“We need to think about masculinity norms and how men are taught to be masculine the same way women are taught to be feminine,” he said in an interview. “More and more, we start to see women push the conversation and we need to do the same for men because the gender roles men try to fit into often leads to violence against women.”

The struggle against violence towards women has been a main focus for gender equality and women’s rights activists since the first feminist movement and extends beyond the boundaries of United States.

“There is personal and collective desire for men to engage in gender equality to improve their personal life and the society they live in,” Krizia Nardini, archeologist and Ph.D. candidate at Open University of Catalonia in Barcelona, said.

According to Nardini, while these men remain a minority in their respective countries, it is a positive trend.

The Man Up Campaign, a conference partner whose main focus is to educate youth on gender equality through the community, is teaming up with Lions Club International to create the largest gender equality education program in India, a country where girls and women suffer such an extreme gender inequality they often fall victim to gang rapes and rarely receive justice.

BBC’s documentary film “India’s Daughter” has caused national and international outrage because of the testimonial of a gang rapist, in which he blamed the victim for being out late as the cause of her rape, and the Indian government’s decision to ban the film.

“The people who commit these acts are mostly uneducated men,” Ghanghyam Kanani, Man Up Campaign’s delegate to India, said.

Kanani and his colleagues Eugene Hung, lead organizer, and Jimmie Briggs, co-founder and director of Man Up Campaign, said the new program, which uses sports, arts and entertainment as platforms to educate Indian youth on gender equality, will prevent gang rapes in the future.

Most of the educators and activists agreed it is crucial to engage young men at an early age in order to instill the idea of gender equality and prevent violence and bullying.

Niobe Way, professor of developmental psychology and author of “Deep Secrets: Boy’s Friendship and the Crisis of Connection,” said the issue lies beyond gender equality.

“The issue is how we attempt to see ourselves as a common humanity,” Way said. “We don’t see boys, men, girls, or women as fully humans, so we create these gender binaries, these racial and sexual stereotypes that are all based on only part human versions of who we are.”

According to Way, boys and girls need to be viewed as equals with both masculine and feminine traits before they can engage in equality.

Kamesh Advani, a member of the Advisory Committee for Saheli, a Boston based organization aimed to help survivors of domestic violence, said mainstream media, which itself is often known for racial and sexual inequalities, is key for youth engagement.

“The message of gender equality is getting out there, but the mainstream media will help speed up the process,” he said.

Because a significant number of youth today engage in some sort of athletic program in middle school and high school where coaches are the authoritative figures, Chuck Derry of Gender Violence Institute implemented a program, Coaching For Change, which trains coaches how to educate youth on violence prevention and gender equality.

The program was so successful it is now a state requirement in Minnesota for coaches to complete the training before gaining their coaching licenses.

There are many more solutions to the question of youth engagement in gender equality and the conference offers a platform for the solutions.

In recognition of the conference, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio proclaimed March 5–8 “International Conference on Masculinity Week.”]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_36989" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-36989" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/CAI6084-600x399.jpg" alt="BRIAN JENKINS / UVM ATHLETICS" width="600" height="399" /> Coach Pikiell and the men's basketball team will face the Great Danes in the America East championship on Saturday, March 14. If they come off with the win, they will advance to the NCAA playoffs, a first in Stony Brook history.  <em>BRIAN JENKINS / UVM ATHLETICS</em>[/caption]
<p dir="ltr">For the second straight year, Stony Brook men’s basketball finds itself one game away from its first NCAA Tournament berth. And for the second straight year, Albany stands in SBU’s way. This time around, the Seawolves find themselves the underdog as the No. 3 seed, but that has not translated to a lack of confidence.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"This is the game that matters,” Head Coach Steve Pikiell said during media availability <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_282347972"><span class="aQJ">on Tuesday</span></span>. “We hadn't beaten Vermont in two games and we went up there and beat them so I don't think the past games mean anything other than I think we can play with anybody in the league."</p>
<p dir="ltr">"We've done it before so we know that we can do it again,” Carson Puriefoy said. “I think it's just a testament to our team as a whole and that we can win on the road, we've shown we can win on the road no matter where we play."</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stony Brook is coming off an upset win at Vermont and already beat Albany in SEFCU Arena during the regular season. Doing so in the championship game will be a whole new challenge, however. How the Seawolves will do so depends on, first and foremost, the play of the reigning America East Player of the Year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Against the Great Danes, Jameel Warney saw less pressure than against other squads. Albany doubled very late in the first meeting and left just one defender on Warney in the latter game. Guarding Warney will be the 6-foot-11-inch Richard Peters, who Warney admits is a tough player to score on.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"He's a big cat. I just have to be aggressive when he's guarding me or when anybody's guarding me. But he is one of the top defenders I have problems with," Warney said. "They don't double team that often because their post defenders are doing a good job on me. I guess I have to be better for them to start double teaming me."</p>
<p dir="ltr">"He's seen every defense there is known to man so doesn't matter. If they want to double him, great. If they want to play him single, great. We've seen it all this year,” Pikiell said. “Whatever they feel like doing, we'll be ready for."</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pikiell also believes Stony Brook will be ready for Albany’s zone defense that gave the Seawolves trouble in last year’s championship game.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"We've seen a lot of zone. If you make shots it doesn't bother you,” Pikiell said. “When I watch tape and I see us taking good shots I'm not bothered at all."</p>
<p dir="ltr">This sense of preparedness stems to how Pikiell has handled the rotation in the past couple games. Against Binghamton, Stony Brook inserted Bryan Sekunda and Chris Braley in the heat of the contest while against Vermont the Seawolves stuck with a tight eight-man rotation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"It depends on the game. Tell me who's blowing the whistle, tell me who's in foul trouble, tell me what we need,” Pikiell said. “I love my bench, I don't hesitate to use any of them. Watch Sekunda, he'll sneak into this game and make some plays.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bench coming up big would be huge for Stony Brook, however the Seawolves will also need their starters to have good games as well. Namely Puriefoy, whose strong second half in Vermont helped secure the win for SBU.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"When I don't make as many shots as I want to I try to get my teammates involved first and then try to take the easy shots and let the game come to me," Puriefoy said. “I know the scouting report's out on me. If they hard hedge that means I can throw it to Jameel which is just as good of a play as me taking a shot. Just adapting to their different types of pressure is what we need to do."</p>
<p dir="ltr">Puriefoy will also have to be in top shape defensively, since he will likely be given the task of slowing down Albany’s speedy point guard Evan Singletary.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"[Singletary's] a great player. I know that, coaching staff knows that,” Puriefoy said. “I think the whole team needs to guard him just as much as I need to guard him. They need to have my back just like I need to have their back when they get beat off the dribble or something along those lines. It's more of a team defensive concept when we guard their best players."</p>
<p dir="ltr">Their best players extend past Singletary, with Sam Rowley and Peter Hooley being the other major threats on the Great Danes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“They have four all-league players so it's not like you can emphasize too much on one player,” Pikiell said. “They have a lot of weapons, they have a lot of good players so we're going to have to play really well on the defensive end and guys are going to have to really buckle down."</p>
<p dir="ltr">Defense has not been an issue for Stony Brook this season, but it will certainly be tested as the Seawolves try to upend Albany on <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_282347973"><span class="aQJ">Saturday, March 14</span></span>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Really excited,” Warney said. “Going to be a long four to five days, can't wait to play <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_282347974"><span class="aQJ">Saturday</span></span> morning."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_36980" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-36980" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/DSC_0126-600x399.jpg" alt="SAHER JAFRI / THE STATESMAN" width="600" height="399" /> Assistant Chief of Police Lawrence M. Zacarese, above, is one of two tweeters behind the "out of an abundance of caution" tweets. <em>SAHER JAFRI / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

From delays to cancellations to a bit of humor, the SBU Emergency Management Twitter has got it all. Its recent rise to fame, sparked by the popularity of the phrase "out of an abundance of caution" that Stony Brook students now directly equate to missing class, was hilarious and helpful for Stony Brook students. But who is behind the tweets?

It is not one but two people who run the @SBUEM account. Lawrence M. Zacarese, the assistant chief of Police and director of the Office of Emergency Management, splits the account with Stony Brook alumnus, Jason Casale. Both men are proud of what the Twitter account has become.

The Twitter page became so popular that is has over two and a half thousand follows and its own line of apparel. Both halves of the duo plan to be sporting an "out of an abundance of caution" sweater as soon as they are delivered.

Zacarese, who is a father of three, says his children "Get a kick out of [the Twitter popularity]."

Spencer Shorkey, the junior pharmacology major who designed the sweaters, said that he went on YikYak and "Someone had a good idea. 'Somebody should make a t-shirt with Out of An Abundance of caution on it.' It had like a hundred up-votes." The sweaters, that are currently on sale feature the Twitter's favorite hashtag as well as a snowflake.

This may mean even more "faithful followers," as Zacarese calls them. He expects the student interaction with the account to weaken as the warmer weather moves in, but hopes that students who read this article will follow them.

Zacarese also notes that "my disclaimer is that the official means of communication is the voice, text and email and everything else. I give the preview to the followers because they are pretty faithful."

When it comes to cancelling classes, Zacarese says that "there's no 'hey I'll get you three thousand followers.' Theres nothing. Student should know that great effort goes into following the storm," and "classes have to be held. We are in the education business but we need to do it safely."

Zacarese said that he hopes the Twitter's popularity  "tears down the perception that the police department may be standoffish." He would like the students and campus to know that "we are not a traditional law enforcement organization."

Jason Casale, the second half of the Twitter duo, says, "the popularity means a lot to us. It means we are doing a good job and getting the word out there."]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Women&#039;s lacrosse takes big home match against Notre Dame</title>

The Seawolves' next matchup is their season's first away game against Jacksonville on Mar. 15  <em>CHRISTOPHER CAMERON / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

On paper, the Stony Brook Seawolves and Notre Dame Fighting Irish lacrosse match was going to be a tight one. Both teams came into the Tuesday-night affair ranked in the top 20 in the country and after 30 minutes it was close, as Stony Brook held a 2-1 lead.

“We went into the locker room and realized how close the game was and how important the game was and everything just clicked,” freshman Kylie Ohlmiller said.

The West Islip, N.Y. native then took control, scoring two of the next three goals and assisting on the other, helping the Seawolves go on a 4-0 early second half run to take control. Joe Spallina’s squad then kept its distance the rest of the way, defeating the Fighting Irish 9-5 at Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium.

“We talked about needing that signature win as a team and taking that step,” the fourth-year Head Coach said. “This was a move in that direction.”

It was Taylor Ranftle and Amber Kupres who got Stony Brook on the board in the first half. Ranftle was given free position just under three minutes into the matchup and she took advantage, running in and slotting it into the bottom of the net to give the Seawolves the early 1-0 lead.

Kupres then added her tally when Jessica Volpe found her in wide open space about 20 yards from the goal, and she was able to run in and score on Notre Dame goalie Liz O’Sullivan to double Stony Brook’s lead.

The Irish were able to strike on a free position goal by Casey Pearsall to make it 2-1 Stony Brook.

It was a great half in net for Kaitlyn Leahy, as the sophomore goalie made six of her nine saves on the night in the first 30 minutes.

“Our defense was lights out,” Spallina said.

In the second half, Ohlmiller tallied all six of her points, including her 10th, 11th, and 12th assists of the season, a team-high.

After the first four goals of the half by Stony Brook, the two teams split the next four goals, keeping the Seawolves lead at five. Notre Dame would break the split trend when Grace Muller and Heidi Annaheim doubled up, dropping the Seawolves lead to three with 4:31 to play in regulation.

“They would score a goal and everybody would be like ‘here comes Notre Dame,’” Spallina said. “But boom, we would score right back.”

It was Ranftle adding her third of the game and of the season on the man-up opportunity with 2:33 to play to give the Seawolves their final lead of 9-5.

“I would equate a win like this to my first year when we beat Johns Hopkins,” Spallina said about his team’s big victory.

His team also felt thrilled after the big victory, as they stormed the field when the final whistle blew to mob their sophomore goalie.

“We have some big games coming up and the fact that we just won this one helps our confidence,” Ohlmiller said.

One problem for the Seawolves this season is the draw controls, and they won the battle in the circle against one of the nation’s best, outdrawing Notre Dame 9-7.

They will look to make it five wins in a row on Sunday afternoon in their first road test of the season, taking on the Jacksonville Dolphins at 1 p.m..]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Balanced attack leads baseball past Fordham</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The best attack in baseball is a balanced attack, and that is what Matt Senk and his Stony Brook baseball team had Wednesday afternoon, taking down the Fordham Rams 6-5 to take a three-game series with the Bronx, N.Y. school.

Mother Nature did not affect the bats, as seven different Seawolves recorded a hit in the matchup and three different players recorded an RBI. In that mix was Jack Parenty, as he launched a two-run home run to right in the top of the second.

It was errors that doomed the Rams in the first, as Stony Brook plated a pair of unearned runs as well as another to take a 3-0 lead before Fordham even had a plate appearance.

Parenty led off the game with a walk, and worked his way home, eventually scoring on a throwing error by Fordham starter Donald May to get Stony Brook on the board.

Toby Handley also worked a walk to get on base, and he eventually found his way home when Cole Peragine chopped an RBI groundout to second base to double the Seawolves lead in the first.

Stony Brook increased their lead to 3-0 when Andruw Gazzola touched home after Johnny Caputo reached on a fielding error by first baseman Matthew Kozuch.

The Rams cut the lead back to one in the bottom half of the first on a Charles Galiano long ball. The junior catcher drilled a Nicholas DiEva pitch to left-center, bringing home Kozuch in the process.

Parenty got the two runs back with his bomb to left-center, the first of the season for the junior outfielder. He also drove in Jeremy Giles.

Fordham was able to tie the game in the bottom of the third and fourth, scoring a pair in the third before knotting it up in the fourth.

Joseph DeVito tied the game at five in the fourth, roping a single to left to bring in Ryan McNally and bring the Rams back even.

The Seawolves took the lead back for good in the top of the seventh, courtesy of Gazzola. He laced a single to right, bringing in Handley to make it 6-5 for good.

Kevin Kernan got his first win of the season, throwing three solid innings, only allowing one run while striking out a pair of Ram batters.

It was Teddy Rodliff picking up his second save of the campaign, throwing the final three innings and only allowing three baserunners. None of them were able to go past second base.

America East play begins this weekend for the Seawolves, as they host the defending champion Binghamton Bearcats for a three-game set. Two games will be played on Saturday, and then one matchup on Sunday.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Stony Brook University alumna Sarah Tubbs met with members of the media on Tuesday, March 10 to discuss the lawsuit she filed against the school for alleged “deliberate indifference” in the handling of her sexual assault case.

According to the complaint filed, <a href="http://sbstatesman.com/2015/02/03/sbu-faces-lawsuit-for-deliberate-indifference-in-allegedly-mishandling-sexual-assault-case/">Tubbs was sexually assaulted on campus by another student on Jan. 26, 2014</a>. After she reported the incident to the University Police Department, received an examination from a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner and reported the incident to the Office of University Community Standards, a disciplinary hearing was scheduled to take place during the spring 2014 finals week.

On May 22, 2014, the day of her graduation, Tubbs was informed that the hearing board found that the alleged assailant, who she is now suing as well, was not responsible. After receiving the written basis for the hearing panel’s decision dated July 9, 2014, Tubbs filed an appeal.

In a letter dated Aug. 28, 2014, Director of Campus Recreation Jay Souza advised her that after reviewing the case, he “found no evidence that the Hearing Board considered the definition of consent found in the University Code of Conduct and/or applied that definition to the facts of this case” and that the finding “constitutes a significant procedural error warranting the granting of your appeal,” according to Tubbs’s lawsuit complaint.

According to the complaint, Tubbs was advised that she would be contacted by the Office of Community Standards with the next steps in the appeals process, but did not receive any further information.

Tubbs’ lawyer, Amy Attias of Sussman and Watkins, said that on March 6, 2015 at about 9:15 p.m., Tubbs received an email from Stony Brook University’s Director of the Office of Community Standards Matty Orlich describing that although Souza, the appellate officer, had found the hearing board had not taken into account the definition of consent and intoxication, they did in fact take the definition into account and the appeal was found against Tubbs.

<em>The following is a transcript of Tubbs’ interview. </em>The Statesman<em> is publishing Tubbs’ name with her expressed permission to do so.</em> The Statesman<em> is withholding the name of the alleged assailant as he has not been criminally charged. The questions in the transcription have been modified for clarity purposes.</em>

<b>The New Republic</b>: I want to thank you for taking the time to speak with us. I want to ask you about your motivations for why you want to speak out and what you hope the outcome of this case is, whether it’s making sure that other people, other students, not just at Stony Brook, but throughout SUNY, throughout the country are kind of aware of their rights and what changes in policy you hope to see in the future.

<b>Sarah Tubbs:</b> I can say, starting off, it’s not easy to come out about this, and I really have one concrete motivation coming out about it, and it’s so that no other victim has to go through a system I went through. In my opinion, if I survived the system, barely, then no one should have to go through it. It was horrendous and if I can save someone else from having to do that by sitting here and talking to you all today, then I’ll do it. It’s definitely challenging.

<b>News 12:</b> Can you tell us a little bit about the process you had to go through at your university where you basically had to face or hear your assailant?

<b>Sarah Tubbs:</b> It was five hours long, there was a paper screen with a hole in it separating us, and I was forced to prepare questions for  the perpetrator. I was questioned by him, I had to prepare witnesses and he had a witness and then we would receive questions from the hearing board. But on an emotional level, that’s the last place I would want to be. I had asked for my therapist to be there. I’ve been diagnosed for a while now with PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder], and they denied her. They said it would be unfair even though she had been in other hearings before for sexual assault, they said that with mine it would be unfair. They put me next to the door so that way in case anything happened, I could leave but there was no security, there [wasn’t] any type of protection and honestly, the worst part of the hearing was hearing his voice and then having his voice talk to me because he asked me questions. If you could imagine the worst place you would want to be with your worst enemy and then allowing them to ask you questions about how they assaulted you, it’s awful.

<b>News12:</b> In most cases of sexual assault or rape, the victim never sees the attacker until the court of law. What do you think about a process that happens on a university campus compared to what happens anywhere else?

<b>Sarah Tubbs</b>: I mean, I honestly don’t think universities are equipped to handle cases of sexual assault. I think when you think about the prevalence of sexual assault on college campuses and the inadequacies of the system that’s there, it’s just horrendous. I feel like schools try so hard to protect their image of being a safe school and I think Stony Brook has clearly demonstrated that, they’re more concerned about their image than safety. I worked at Stony Brook while I was a student for three years and they still didn’t want to protect me. They wanted to protect their image. Instead I felt like I did something wrong, the way I was treated. [It was] that I did something wrong and not him.

<b>The Statesman</b>: What was your experience with the campus officials you worked with and how they treated you? Did you feel like they were qualified to handle your case?

<b>Sarah Tubbs</b>: When I first went into [Community Standards] office, they were pretty welcoming, and one of the first things [Matty Orlich] said was that "you wouldn’t be talking to me right now if nothing happened to you," and that was something that really resonated with me and made me feel comfortable pursuing with Community Standards because I had been so poorly treated by the police that I was like "she’ll do the right thing." As soon as I believe that she realized that I was going to pursue a case with Community Standards, the communication became much more hostile, much more hard to communicate with her to the point where because I was and still am so emotionally distressed by it, I would have someone call on behalf of me and they would get told that she wasn’t available, they would get two word answers from her, they would get brushed off, she would tell me that the next meeting would be in the next two weeks, and then I wouldn’t hear from her for like a month. She was doing every passive-aggressive motive to try and get me to not go through with the case, which was really, really challenging because when I decided to go through with Community Standards, it was so that way he knew he did something wrong. I just, I didn’t want him to hurt someone else like he hurt me. I didn’t need him to be put in jail, I just wanted him to not hurt someone else, and Community Standards didn’t give me that.

<b>The Statesman:</b> Now that you’ve gone through the Stony Brook process, what do you think they did that was particularly hurtful?

<b>Sarah Tubbs: </b>I mean, the entirety of the process. I think each system in schools across the country that have come to attention have had their own flaws and each school has its different flaws. You can’t say one is worse than another, one is worse because of this or that, it doesn’t really work that way. But I would say all of it would be the deterring me from suing and coming from the emotional point where I was at, to deter someone from pursuing, it takes a lot of effort to continue. It takes a lot of effort to continue if you’re mentally stable and you don’t have PTSD so to put that on top of it and to be doing two majors, working two jobs and to graduate and to apply for grad school, it was a lot. And then the other part would be having to sit in the room with him and have him question me.

<b>The New Republic: </b>Since the facts of your case and other similar cases around the country, Governor Cuomo and the SUNY administration, at least publicly, made an effort to kind of address this issue. I wanted to know what your thoughts were on the new policy, if you’re familiar with it. Because it seems like several pieces of it, the university directly violated. Obviously it wasn’t on the books when the university was hearing your case but if a similar case were to happen now, if you think any of the facts would have changed?

<b>Sarah Tubbs</b>: I wouldn’t say I’m an expert on the policy by any means but I would say that there needs to be more with it, I don’t think it’s sufficient. I think it’s great that there’s a Survivor’s Bill of Rights, but I think that there needs to be an advocate with them one hundred percent of the way. There needs to be someone that shows them "these are your options,these are your rights," and walks with them through the process because even for me, when I went to the police first, I was given a piece of paper, and it had my options on it and I said "what does this option mean?" and I remember specifically it was the last option, and it was the only one I was considering at the time, the officer told me "I don’t know, just read it.’"[I said] "OK, but what does this mean, it doesn’t make sense to me," and he was like "I don’t know, you can either sign that you’re going to do that option or sign that you’re not going to do anything." And so for me, I was three or four days after being assaulted, being given this form, and these are my options and the officer himself didn’t even know what my options were.

<b>The New Republic: </b>In what ways did the university fail to educate the students, faculty, staff?

<b>Sarah Tubbs: </b>I would say they’ve made, because I still have a lot of friends that are still at school, they’ve made very surface level efforts to make it seem like they’re trying harder. They had something called “Green Dot” training, which was great, but only like a select amount of students were able to go. Mostly it was professional staff, student leaders, and there [were] people there that said they were wasting money on this training, that it didn’t really mean anything, there was people there that only stayed for a part of it and they’re the ones working in the office that deals with people of sexual assault. The students are required to do an online information thing but you can click the answers and just go back and click it until you have it right so you don’t have to read anything or you can sit through an hour or two training, sign a piece of paper that you were there, and you’re done. They’re not teaching them what consent is. They’re not teaching them how not to rape, how not to sexually assault. They’re putting up like these surface-level things that make it look like they’re following with Governor Cuomo. They’re following with what the drive is to try to change policies. They’re making it look like they’re doing it, but nothing’s really being done.

<b>The Statesman: </b>After going through Stony Brook’s process and dealing with UPD and Community Standards, what kind of advice would you have for other students who may have gone through the same thing that you have?

<b>Sarah Tubbs: </b>I think it’s challenging that question right now, and I’ve been asked it before. Honestly I wouldn’t feel comfortable telling people to go through the process of Community Standards. I found it more traumatizing than helpful, especially since nothing happened because they denied the appeal was well. Honestly, I wouldn’t know what to tell them to do. I would say go to outside law enforcement office because UPD did a horrendous job as well, and the lack of empathy for a survivor is just very apparent by UPD to the point where one of the detectives, after he finished—I would use the word interrogated me—he told the other detective in the room that he didn’t know how much longer he could do this, that he was sick and he had a cold. And I had just told him my whole story. I would suggest to go to an outside law enforcement office.

<b>News12: </b>Was there any thought of going to Suffolk County PD?

<b>Sarah Tubbs: </b> Honestly, after being told that I could pursue but more than likely I wouldn’t have a case, I wasn’t going to go.

<b>Newsday: </b>What is the sentiment on campus regarding your case [from the student body and professional staff]?

<b>Sarah Tubbs</b>: My best friend on campus, Christine, is working on a committee, it’s called VIP [Violence, Intervention and Prevention], but it has to do with intimate partner violence. They have been working on understanding the policy better and what the policy is at Stony Brook and now they’re working on changing it and promoting change on campus. There’s definitely been some widespread attention on the campus of this being an issue and Stony Brook not doing anything about it. From the student body perspective, there’s definitely been a push to try and get things to change but the university hasn’t responded. From professional staff perspective, there’s a handful in the bunch of professional staff that are also trying to push things to change, but the majority don’t really see it as an issue.

<b>Newsday: </b>Have you been back-and-forth with any professors, any students?

<b>Sarah Tubbs</b>: I communicate with former classmates, my friends, I communicate with some former colleagues, some former supervisors, so I definitely still have strong ties [to the school].

<b>The Statesman:</b> How do you feel about <a href="http://www.lohud.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/02/27/stony-brook-puts-student-safety-first/24068671/">Peter Baigent’s op-ed</a> as what he said conflicts with your story?

<b>Sarah Tubbs</b>: Just to kind of clear things up, Stony Brook on paper may have an OK policy, but it’s not what happens, and I can tell you that technically he was supposed to ask the question, the hearing officer was supposed to repeat the question to me, and then I was supposed to answer. That happened maybe two or three times, the rest of the time it was just him talking and me responding. So that’s false, from what happened. That may be what’s on paper, but it’s not what happens, and that’s kind of the central theme for what happened.

It was a wild experience, for sure."  <em>ZACH ROWE / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

I am going to start off by blowing your mind. For those that do not know, Stony Brook is not much of a party school. Shocking, I know. While other schools may be known for their recreations of “Animal House,” the average Stony Brook student’s idea of a big celebration is not failing a biology exam. 
Personally, my spring break is going to be spent home studying for three upcoming midterms. However, we are cool with that, for the most part. We knew what we signed up for and in return for not partying four days a week, we receive an actual education.

As a proud man of half-Irish descent, the time to party came during St. Patrick’s Day, but the local festivities were sorely lacking. So I did what any logical person would do: I made the six-and-a-half-hour-trek to Binghamton University with a couple of my friends 

For those that do not know, Binghamton is rather notorious for its Saint Paddy’s Day festivities. The website BroBible.com ranked it the 10th-best college party in the nation; some reports peg the participant count at over 50,000 people.  

So obviously, when we heard about this, my friends and I asked everyone we know at Binghamton to clear a spot on their dorm floor for this wild bacchanalia. Soon enough, March 6 rolled around and we all set off.
The ride up was pretty hellish. The combination of rush hour traffic in the Bronx and my friend controlling the aux cable was not fun at all. However, after what seemed like the billionth time listening to “I’m Gonna Be” by The Pretenders, we finally made it.

The night that we arrived was spent catching up with old high school friends and experiencing the not-so-shocking revelation that a sleeping bag on a hard wooden dorm floor did not make for a good night’s sleep. It did not matter though, because the next day was the much vaunted Parade Day.

Our alarms sounded early, as Parade Day starts for many at 8 a.m. For some, the drinking began soon after (I was the designated shepard for me and my friends to downtown Binghamton, where the festivities are held. Stay safe kids), By about 10:30, we had made our way into the heart of the revelries.

The first thing I noticed was that while there were not 50,000 people there, there was still a substantial number of people in downtown Binghamton. 

There were huge mobs of people lining the streets and pretty much every frat house had opened its doors for potential party goers. It was a wild experience for sure. 

As far as parties go, this was probably better than anything I better been to at Stony Brook. The party had soon died down for my friends and I by 4 p.m., and we headed back to campus. 
We got food at one of the Binghamton dining halls, where I was shocked to see a full meal of a cheeseburger, fries and a drink come out to $3.75 on my friends meal card. 

It was quite an overwhelming feeling of superiority, eating much better food after a much better party against a backdrop of beautiful mountain ranges that Stony Brook did not come close to offering.Yet, talking to people at Binghamton, they sounded shockingly similar to our peers here at Stony Brook. 

They complained as loudly as we do about the food and bemoaned the workload of their classes. My friend said that Parade Day was the most school spirit they ever show. I realized a few things on the way back. First, “I’m Gonna Be” by The Pretenders had become my favorite road trip song of all time. 

Secondly, though, I got a reminder of the old phrase that “the grass is not always greener on the other side.” People are going to start complaining about their surroundings no matter where they are. 

There is always going to be something about somewhere else that makes you want to leave. In the end though, as much as I want a party like Parade Day or food like Binghamton’s for Stony Brook, I still would not trade Stony Brook for the world. It is my school and no matter how great Binghamton seemed, I knew the grass was not greener, despite the fact that I could not actually see the grass through the snow at either school.]]></content:encoded>

As anyone who has a long term goal or project will tell you it is important to look back and see just how far you have come from where you started. Whether it be building a birdhouse or trying to find the Higgs-Boson, remembering how you started, seeing progress and appreciating how much you have accomplished feels good and in some cases, it inspires you finish whatever it is you are doing.

I take great pleasure in looking at the progression of life and man-made structures. I marvel at how a human goes from being an infant, small enough to be held in one hand, potentially grow into a 6-foot-7-inch and 275-pound Hulk of a person. I find it fascinating how the steel beams on Toll Drive will eventually become our newest residence hall (probably a year or two later than we were promised, but that is beside the point).
One of my favorite things to put in perspective is technology. Throughout my lifetime, I have gone from running Windows 98 on big, bulky beige monitors to using Windows 8 on a touchscreen laptop. And if you look at technology as whole, we have gone from clunky, monochrome machines that could run one program at a time to sleek, futuristic computers that are one-third the size and exponentially faster. I remember playing “Snake” on an old Nokia 9000 when I was little; it had the pull-out antenna and everything. Now I cannot decide which app to use first on my (thankfully antenna free) smartphone.

It is also impressive to watch the youth of today use this technology. Their mastery is one that is not taught, but almost innately develops. I remember sitting in class in high school, groaning with impatience while my teachers tried to figure how to use the SmartBoard. They would fumble with controls and after wasting 10 minutes, we would end up with a projection that was too small to read and at the same time out of focus. Do not even get me started on when they tried to calibrate those things.

We are doing more with technology than we ever have before. A couple of weeks ago, I saw on the news that Samsung was partnering with IKEA to put wireless chargers in couches. As someone who used Velcro, binder clips and tape to try and find that perfect charger placement, this is an absolute blessing. SanDisk, best known for its USB flash drives and MicroSD cards, just developed a 200 GB MicroSD card. That is computer-level amount of storage, implanted in your phone. Even the most advanced iPods only had 160GB; this new card allows even the most dedicated audiophile to have a music collection and still retain a healthy 40GB plus the phone’s built-in storage for media and apps.

Out of all the developments that inspired me to write his story, I think the most striking is Apple’s announcement. According to TechCrunch, and in conjunction with Oxford and Stanford, Apple’s new app 
ResearchKit turns any willing participant with an iPhone into a volunteer for research that could help tackle some pretty big diseases. This combats issues like sample size and human laziness, which plague current medical research. The app is open-source too, meaning more app developers can get their hands on it. 

Only tests/surveys regarding Parkinson’s, diabetes, asthma, breast cancer and cardiovascular disease exist right now, but I can not wait to see how the app expands. Or better yet, when they will have they first major research breakthrough.

There are some people that might view all of this and have to fight the urge to make a reference to 1984. Some may say that technology is starting to make up too much of our lives, invading our personal space and impede our humanity.I agree, but only to a certain degree.

We need to be careful not to let technology take away our humanity (the way we do with social media), but I believe that these innovations, and most innovations are for the better. 

Our world is changing and we need to keep up with it. More than ever our lives and information is digitized on a mountainous scale. The easier information flow gets, the higher we can climb up that mountain. Eventually, we may even reach the summit of seamless and perfect integration.]]></content:encoded>

Four times this semester, it was deemed too dangerous for Stony Brook students to attend classes. But for this wheelchair-bound Seawolf, it was too dangerous to attend class upwards of ten times.

Two weeks ago, for one Japanese language course, I was forced to miss an entire week’s worth of lectures due to the weather. As you could imagine, it has not been easy for me to keep up academically when I cannot even get to the Academic Mall or have to avoid leaving my dorm because a small flurry may leave me stranded far from Roosevelt Quad. My professors have been quite accommodating, allowing me to push deadlines and submit work electronically, but it only helps so much.

How is a student to succeed in a traditional university when he can not navigate that environment? My fear is that I cannot, though not for lack of trying. I ended my first semester with a 3.7; now I worry if I can keep my GPA above a 2.5. I stay up all night almost every other weekday to complete the work for my current class assignments while also playing keep up for the previous week.

To my friends, I have coined the week in which I write this story at 3 a.m. the “Week of Lovecraftian Madness.” As I juggle the likes of three mid-terms, journalism assignments and a quiz, I have also been trying to teach myself a unit of Japanese my class learned a week ago in preparation for an exam before spring break. I might as well have looked upon Lovecraft’s Cthulhu, because I feel about as mad as those who do.

Do I believe the university is responsible for the storms that have left me without energy or time to relax? No, of course not, and honestly I think the maintenance crews did a nearly-perfect job clearing the campus for every student on two legs.

For me to be able to navigate campus safely, I need sidewalks, crosswalks and most pathways clear. It is not much to ask for, yet following practically every single one of the winter storms, I came across a critical part of my commute where overcoming the snow was about as likely as a faith healer curing my cerebral palsy.

At this point, I do not foresee more snow related issues this semester, but I ask anyone who is willing to listen, ask the university to work harder next year so maybe students with disabilities can attend spring semester classes without having to go through herculean labors to cross a street.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>A Stony Brook University student, who has been accused of sexual assault by an SBU alumna, is now seeking $10 million for alleged slander and libel.</em>

<em>The male student, <a href="http://sbstatesman.com/2015/02/03/sbu-faces-lawsuit-for-deliberate-indifference-in-allegedly-mishandling-sexual-assault-case/">who is being sued</a> by alumna <a href="http://sbstatesman.com/2015/03/12/sarah-speaks-plaintiff-in-sexual-assault-case-addresses-flaws-in-stony-brook-judiciary-system/">Sarah Tubbs</a>, filed a request through his lawyer on March 11 for a trial by jury and for Tubbs’s complaint to be dismissed by United States District Court, Southern District Of New York. <a href="http://sbstatesman.com/2015/02/03/sbu-faces-lawsuit-for-deliberate-indifference-in-allegedly-mishandling-sexual-assault-case/">Tubbs is also suing the university</a>.</em>

<em>Tubbs filed the lawsuit on Jan. 23, 2015. She is suing the male student for the alleged Jan. 26, 2014 sexual assault as well as Stony Brook University for the manner in which the administration allegedly handled her complaint under Title IX. Title IX is the federal clause that prohibits discrimination based on sex at any federally-funded educational institution.</em>

<em>The Statesman is publishing Tubbs’s name with her expressed permission to do so. However, The Statesman is withholding the name of the alleged assailant as he has not been criminally charged.</em>

<em>The defendant said in the response that while he did meet Tubbs on the night of the alleged assault, he did not assault her. According to the defendant, the two went to his dormitory and engaged in sexual activity. His response to Tubbs’s lawsuit complaint states that Tubbs “knowing[ly] and voluntarily consented to any touching” by him and that the allegations “damaged his professional and personal reputation.”</em>

<em>“Further, the allegations made by Plaintiff [Tubbs] against [name withheld] were so incendiary, that it is was natural [sic], and foreseeable consequence, that the spurious allegations would be repeated throughout the school and the community,” the defendant’s response states. “As a result of the publication of the complaint to third parties accusing [name withheld] of sexual assault and rape, it has become common knowledge at Stony Brook and has greatly injured in his reputation [sic].”</em>

<em>Tubbs's lawsuit complaint and the defendant's response both state that during a hearing conducted by Stony Brook's Office of University Community Standards for Tubbs's Title IX complaint, Tubbs and the defendant were separated by a paper screen.</em>

<em>“Despite the presence of the screen, nothing could address the trauma of having to question, and be questioned by, this man,” Tubbs's complaint states.</em>

<em>Both Tubbs’s lawsuit complaint and the defendant’s response also state that the university found him not responsible for sexual assault.</em>

<em>The defendant is seeking $10 million, plus the cost of the suit, in reparations for slander and libel. The Law Offices of Stewart Lee Karlin, P.C., is representing the defendant.</em>

<em>At the time of publication, The Statesman could not obtain any written counterclaims from Stony Brook University in response to Tubbs’s lawsuit through the federal courts' public records system.</em>

<em>For more of </em>The Statesman’s<em> coverage of and relating to Title IX, click <a href="http://sbstatesman.com/tag/title-ix/">here</a>.</em>

<b>Monday, April 20, 7:52 p.m.</b>: The defendant has amended his counterclaims, which now state that he denies the allegation in Sarah Tubbs's complaint that “Stony Brook’s response to the harassment Plaintiff [Tubbs] experienced, as alleged herein, was clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances, and, thus was deliberately indifferent.” A previous version of the defendant's counterclaims stated that he admitted to the aforementioned allegation.

<em><strong>Clarification: March 13, 2015</strong></em>

<em>In a previous version of this story, </em>The Statesman<em> reported that it could not obtain Stony Brook University's official response to Sarah Tubbs's lawsuit complaint at the time of publication. The story should have specified that </em>The Statesman<em> sought to obtain such records through the federal courts' public records system, not the university.</em>]]></content:encoded>

&nbsp;

A break is a rarity
Here at SBU.
We get days off sparingly
Not even for the Jews.

Next week is our one break
All semester long
How shall I make the most of it?
I don’t want to get it wrong

Cancun is too cliché
Boston is too cold
Even for the feast day
Of Saint Patty and his gold.

The beach could be fun
Swimming in a sea of green
Enjoying the bright, warm sun
With coeds and drunken fiends

What am I even saying?
I’m a student after all
I cannot go anywhere
The cost is much too tall.

I’m going to end up home
Watching “House of Cards”
Listening to my parents groan
“Go shovel the damn yard.”

“We saw that picture on Facebook.”
“Tell us about that girl.”
“We heard from Cousin Chase.”
Already I want to hurl.

Sleep will be nice.
There is none during the year.
Parents are just the price
Of getting out of here.

No matter what you do
With your spring break options
Please take my advice and do so
With an overabundance of caution.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The stories of a promiscuous spring break down in Florida or tramp stamps received in Panama or barefoot nights on the beach in Costa Rica only exist in Mary-Kate and Ashley movies and country songs. College students, particularly Stony Brook students, generally save that remaining $28.17 in their bank account for a bottle of Smirnoff to celebrate the end of the semester. Here is what spring break is really like. While it’s not quite as magical as drinking tequila under the Mexican sky in the arms of a tanned, muscular man named Juan whose English is non-existent but whose tongue still functions according to plan, it is still a pretty great way to spend a week off. This is what a turnt-down Stony Brook spring break is like.

<b>SATURDAY</b>

Sleep until 3:00 p.m. to catch up on all the sleep you have been missing.  Binge watch “House of Cards” to catch up with everyone else. Stay up until 3 a.m. to do so.

<b>SUNDAY
</b>

Only sleep until noon because you have only been awake for 12 hours the whole weekend. Meet up with your high school friends that you ignore the entire semester but meet up with faithfully every break. Smoke a joint, eat an entire bacon and pineapple Domino’s pizza, feel so guilty you go to sleep for as long as possible to try and sleep off the pizza.

<strong>MONDAY</strong>

Put real clothes on for the first time because your mom told you that you will never be a doctor if you live in sweatpants. Take out your textbooks and leave them on your desk in case a wave of ambition overtakes you.

<b>TUESDAY</b>

Masturbate the entire day. Literally the entire day.

<b>WEDNESDAY</b>

Take your first shower of spring break and finally shave your armpits. This may take two attempts. Finish season 6B of “Sex and the City.” Sit holding a notebook for two hours watching “Sex and the City,” trying to write your next article for your column. That one might be a little personal.

<b>THURSDAY</b>

Tell yourself you seriously need to study for that orgo test next week. Also tell yourself that you should probably also start working out because you can still see the effects of that Domino’s pizza on your thighs. Play Xbox for 10 straight hours. Go to dinner at Grandma’s house because your family is complaining that they never see you just to listen to them ask you where your non-existent boyfriend is.

<b>FRIDAY</b>

Probably do something in Queens because I feel like that is what everyone in Stony Brook does in their free time.

<b>SATURDAY</b>

Finally do laundry because you have been going commando for the last four days and you forgot what it is like to wear underwear.

<strong>SUNDAY</strong>

Zip the bag that you never actually unpacked, load it in the car, and prepare to return to the real world.  Savor your last home-cooked meal for another eight weeks while you stomach turns at the thought of returning to overcooked pasta and undercooked rice. Upon returning to school, cram for that orgo test you ignored all of spring break to do absolutely nothing and seamlessly return to Stony Brook life.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Ambush on police officers create a wider gap between two torn groups</title>

LOUIS POST-DISPATCH / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE " width="600" height="431" /> An unidentified shooter wounded two police officers during what began as a peaceful protest in Ferguson, M.O. early this morning.<em> ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE</em>[/caption]

A few weeks ago , two officers—one from the Webster Groves Police Department and one from the St. Louis County Police Department—were shot by a gunman at what started as a peaceful protest and quickly took a turn for the worst.

The suspected shooter, Jeffrey Williams, shot one officer in the face and another in the shoulder, incapacitated both of them and caused wide-spread panic among the many protesters and police officers that were on the scene.

First and foremost, this was not just an accidental shooting, or even one that happened in the heat of the moment.

It was clear from both amateur videos and witness testimonies that this was a planned, thought-out attack. 
This ambush had to have been meticulously planned by a coward who decided he would shoot two officers from the middle of a large crowd.
On top of this, the shooter had to have been incompetent, thankfully, since he or she failed to kill either one of the officers at point blank range. 

I mean, taking pot shots at unsuspecting standing officers clearly has to be a difficult task if this moron failed to do it.

But instead of berating this worthless piece of human trash, I would rather focus on the finer issue: that an action like this does nothing but separate two already polarized groups.

I am almost positive everyone has heard about what happened at Ferguson last year, and as such I would be beating a dead horse if I recalled the events that transpired in this small community.

However, the repercussions of what happened in Ferguson are still felt nationwide: many people were and are still protesting “police brutality,” especially at Ferguson. Hell, a peaceful protest is where all of this action went down.
But the shooting of these officers does nothing to mend any torn feelings between the police and the protesters. 

If anything, it makes the tensions felt between the two groups exponentially worse because now police officers all across the nation will be fearful and worried there could be a potential assassin hidden among the ranks of peaceful protesters. 
They might be more inclined to dole out punishment more harshly since they will be more afraid for their lives, which will in turn cause a negative reaction from the peaceful protesters who never even wanted violence in. 

It will be a never ending response of push and shove between the two groups, and unfortunately, it will lead to more problems than answers.
So what is the right course of action in a situation like this? 
Hopefully whoever was behind this heinous crime will be caught, tried and punished to the fullest extent of the law. 

It would be optimistic to hope that no one else gets this sort of idea, though if we remember the two NYPD officers who were executed for a reason similar to the reason that got these two officers shot, then these thoughts seem more of a dream than a reality.
Hopefully, we as a society will be able to ban together and stop not only police brutality, but also the retaliation against officers of the law. 

At the end of the day, the men and women in blue are human just like me and you. 
They have families and loved ones, hopes and dreams; none of these should be erased due to the deranged thoughts of one coward who was able to get a gun.]]></content:encoded>

BASIL JOHN / THE STATESMAN" width="600" height="400" /></a> Ann Curry, above, spoke on the many aspects of journalism which she has learned from her years of experience. She personally believes that the field of reporting is still growing every day. <em>BASIL JOHN / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

Stony Brook University hosted Ann Curry, the Emmy-winning international news correspondent and former anchor for NBC, at the Staller Center for the Arts for a Marie Colvin Distinguished Lecture on Tuesday, March 10.

Curry is a member of the advisory board for the School of Journalism’s Marie Colvin Center for International Reporting and has reported in Sudan, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Darfur, Haiti, Rwanda and Japan. She most recently covered the nuclear arms talks with Iran in Geneva.

She has interviewed influential figures throughout her career, including General Tommy Franks directly from the USS Theodore Roosevelt in Afghanistan, and Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and Chadian President Idriss Déby while investigating ethnic cleansing in the area. She was also the first Western journalist to talk to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.

Curry took the stage with a talk about the relevance of journalism for the next  generation. She spoke passionately about the ethics of journalism and the transforming role of news in the digital age.

With “page views, downloads, followers, and retweets,” as measures of popularity, as Curry described it, she made a point that the quality of the story is what should always come first.

“If no one knows about a thing, does it practically exist?” Curry said. “How does an uninformed world even begin to set it right?”

Although journalists might be considered a doomed population by some, Curry argued that with the rise of technology, the number of journalists has increased with the idea that everyone has a voice and that they have a duty to the world around them.

“Would Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen have been allowed to happen had YouTube and Twitter existed?,” she said. “I doubt it. The greatest weapon today against inhumanity is an uploaded video and the outrage it sparks.”

According to Curry, the standards of honorable journalism include obeying privacy laws, striving for accuracy, and protecting sources no matter the outcome, even if it means going to jail. Yet, one important ethic is often forgotten.

“I believe that being willing to stand up and fight for stories that matter to the world is a fundamental ethic of journalism,” Curry said.

Professor Steven Reiner, the Emmy Award-winning former producer of the CBS program “60 Minutes,” led the discussion with Curry, and the audience members were allowed to ask questions.

When asked to comment on Brian Williams of NBC Nightly News, who recently admitted to mistating the facts of a story he covered in Iraq, she chose not to speak on the subject.

The event brought in not only journalism students but members of the greater Stony Brook community of all ages.

“I think she spoke from the heart,” Elaine Cohen, a student of the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute for retired and semi-retired individuals, said. “I like what she represented. She represents the people she reports about, not herself. The people are the story. She’s not a celebrity.”

On the other end of the age spectrum was Emily Wicks, 15, of Ward Melville High School. She said she attended the lecture because her mother wanted her to see “a very successful woman” speak.

Curry discussed how the role of certain groups, including women, are evolving. She also noted that it used to be acceptable to see young kids begging for food or working for factories, a practice that today would be considered child abuse. She added that genocide was once a normal part of war, but is now considered a war crime.

“Your generation has seen humanity fall, and I am sorry that you are growing up in a time of terrorism and war, fear and cruelty,” Curry said. “But make no mistake,humankind is evolving towards greater empathy as a species. I've seen it in my lifetime and you will see it in yours.”]]></content:encoded>

Peter Hooley leapt on top of the media table as Albany fans crowded behind him, scouring the SEFCU Arena hardwood in celebration. Kameron Mitchell and Rayshaun McGrew stood in disbelief with hands above their heads at what had just unfolded. After controlling the majority of the second half, the Seawolves could only watch as a last-second Peter Hooley three gave the Great Danes a one-point lead and once again killed Stony Brook’s dreams of an NCAA Tournament berth. Final score: Albany 51, Stony Brook 50.

“Credit to Albany, they buckled down towards the end of the game and we made some mistakes,” Carson Puriefoy said following the loss. “He hit a tough shot. Sometimes that happens.”

With under two minutes to play and the Seawolves up five, Jameel Warney was able to get the ball under the rim but was fouled and missed both free throws. Missed chances at the stripe would be the nail in the coffin for SBU, as the team as a whole shot just 10-19 from the line. Sam Rowley, who finished with 12 points after an 0-of-7 first half, scored on the other end to cut the Danes deficit to three with 1:01 remaining.

An inbounds pass to Puriefoy, who had taken over the game with three pull-up threes in the final minutes, then slipped through the guard’s grasp, handing the ball back to Albany. Mike Rowley was fouled on an offensive rebound and hit both free throws to cut the deficit to one.

Puriefoy sunk one-of-two free throws. Ray Sanders then missed a layup to tie the game and the ball was tipped out to Hooley at the top of the key to sink the dagger, Albany’s first trey of the night.

Outside of Puriefoy (23 points) and Warney (20 points and 11 rebounds), Stony Brook scored just seven points on 2-of-19 shooting in the contest. The game ended as it began, with SBU flustered and sluggish play dominating. The score was tied at two points apiece until the 13:17 mark, with both teams playing stifling defense.

“That’s our core value, playing defense,” Warney said. “Our offense didn’t come for a while in the first half. Then once the offense came we were pretty good.”

The Seawolves were held back early on by junior Rayshaun McGrew picking up a couple of fouls and the raucous crowd forcing Head Coach Steve Pikiell to come out to near halfcourt just to call a play. Despite this and 1-of-14 shooting out of the gate, Stony Brook kept it close.

Albany’s largest first-half lead of six quickly dissipated when the Seawolves forcefed Warney the ball. Warney immediately went to work, taking advantage of the Great Danes’ conservative coverage and scoring 12 first-half points. Aiding in the boost in offense was Pikiell inserting Scott King at the four, helping spread the floor for Warney. Behind a 7-0 run to close the half, Stony Brook went into halftime ahead 20-16 following a three by Puriefoy.

Albany opened the second half with a revived effort to score down low and did so effectively. However, the Danes still could not contain Warney on the other end of the floor.

Looking to deny Warney and grind the Seawolves offense to a halt, Albany switched to a zone around the 16-minute mark. Although zone defenses hurt past Stony Brook offenses, this was not the case today. The Seawolves kept in stride, even taking their biggest lead of the night at seven.

The Danes would not go away easily, though. The zone did keep Warney at bay, while both teams missed shots they have made all season. Almost symbolically, a kicked ball smacked the scoreboard hanging from the ceiling, much to the amusement of the crowd.

Albany’s late game push and last-second score sealed Stony Brook’s fate yet again and now, the Seawolves will head back to Long Island to regroup, with their entire team returning next year.

“Just came down to the last ten seconds,” Warney said. “We’ll be back next year.”

But to SBU fans, hearing “next year” come March has become redundant and unbearable.

And once again, many SBU fans must be wondering right now if it will ever be their team’s turn to dance." <em>HEATHER KHALIFA / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

“Wait ’til next year.”

For a good portion of the 40s and 50s, that was the unofficial slogan for the Brooklyn Dodgers, a baseball franchise that always built up plenty of anticipation with exciting regular seasons, but ultimately broke the hearts of its fanbase every year with disappointing finishes in the postseason.

The slogan seems rather fitting for the Stony Brook men’s basketball program, which has put up at least 20 wins in five of its last six seasons, but has ultimately always come up short of winning a conference championship.

During the final seconds of Saturday’s America East championship rematch between the Seawolves and the Great Danes, it appeared as if Stony Brook was ready to finally put an end to the heartbreak. The duo of Jameel Warney and Carson Puriefoy had carried their team to a 50-48 advantage and were just one defensive stop away from securing the program’s first NCAA tournament appearance.

Then came a final 17 seconds that probably made even the least superstitious Seawolves fans out there believe that there may be some sort of curse looming over this program.

Albany’s Ray Sanders drove the lane only to see his shot attempt hit off the top of the backboard. The shot's rebound was tipped out to the top of the key, and with 3.7 seconds remaining, Peter Hooley was there wide open to retrieve the ball, and then knock down the seemingly impossible game-winning three-point shot.

Without a doubt, Stony Brook suffered some unfortunate luck on the game’s final sequence. But the team still can be blamed for letting a multi-possession lead in the championship game’s final minutes slip away.

After a pair of made free throws from Puriefoy with 1:56 remaining, the Seawolves were up 49-42 and seemingly had their ticket punched to the big dance. But a quick jumper by Albany’s Evan Singletary, followed by two missed free throws from Warney, put the Great Danes right back in the game.

With just under a minute remaining, the Seawolves' lead was down to three. But, the team still seemed to be in control of the game, until an inbounds pass from Rayshaun McGrew went right through the hands of his intended target, Puriefoy, and out of bounds.

The miscue from the junior point guard proved to be crucial, as the Great Danes would receive the ball and maintain possession until Mike Rowley nailed down two clutch free throws with 21.7 seconds remaining.

The Seawolves finally made their way back to the free throw line on their next possession, but Puriefoy was only able to make 1-of-2 from the line. From there, Hooley would break the hearts of Stony Brook fans for the second-straight season and provide a devastating finish to what had been another strong campaign for the program.

For those who do not remember, Hooley hit a crucial three pointer with 1:04 remaining in last year’s America East championship game which all but secured the win for Albany.

Although the failures of Warney and Puriefoy stand out when looking back at the game’s final minutes, it is hard to put too much blame on the two men, considering they were the reason that the Seawolves came so close to dancing this spring.

When Stony Brook came out of the gate ice cold from the field, scoring just two points in the game’s first 9:51, it was Warney who kept the team in it. The America East Player of the Year scored 12 of his team’s 20 first half points, dominated on the glass and did a terrific job of keeping Albany’s interior offense to a limit in the game’s first twenty minutes.

Late in the second half, the Great Danes put tremendous defensive pressure on Warney and sent out a challenge to the rest of the Seawolves that another player would have to make big shots if they wanted to dethrone Albany. Puriefoy accepted that challenge.

The man known as “Tre” lived up to his name, draining three shots from behind the arc in the game’s final 6:11.

But, the two men’s efforts were not enough, and the Seawolves did not seem to have another scoring option to help them carry the load down the stretch. McGrew, who has averaged nearly nine points a game this season, found himself in early foul trouble and was never able to make much of an impact offensively.

He was held scoreless, just like two of the team’s others starters, Roland Nyama and Deshaun Thrower. The two first year Seawolves, both playing in their first conference championship games, got off to slow starts from the field and saw their shot opportunities cut drastically as the game continued on. Nyama rode the bench for much of the contest, only getting 10 minutes of action.

It is hard to believe that Stony Brook was almost able to escape with a win against the now three-time defending conference champions, considering Seawolf players not named Warney or Puriefoy combined for just seven points in the game.

The Seawolves should be given credit for their strong defensive effort. They held Albany to just 31.1 percent from the field and denied the Great Danes a three-pointer until the game’s final seconds.

But in the end, Stony Brook did still fall short of its ultimate goal of reaching the NCAA tournament. And once again, many SBU fans must be wondering right now if it will ever be their team’s turn to dance.

Looking on the bright side, which admittedly is hard to do right after a heartbreaking loss like this one, the Seawolves will likely have their entire roster returning next season.

The conference’s best player, Warney, will be back with another year of experience under his belt. SBU will always have a chance to achieve big things with him in the lineup.

Also returning as seniors will be Puriefoy, McGrew and Scott King, all providing a strong leadership core for the team moving forward.

The Seawolves will also have an exciting group of young players in Nyama, Thrower, Tyrell Sturdivant and Jakub Petras returning this fall. None of them seemed ready to make a big impact in this year’s championship game, but perhaps after another year of development, they will be.

It is hard for an SBU fan to be anything but gloomy after a game like today’s. However, it is important for them to remember that the window for this group to win an America East championship is far from closed. This version of the Warney-led Seawolves will be back for one more run at an NCAA tournament berth. The team was not ready to dance this season, but perhaps by next year they will be.

The Brooklyn Dodgers finally had their day on Oct. 4, 1955, when they defeated the New York Yankees in game seven of the World Series to finally earn their first championship. They finally had their day, and the slogan “wait ’til next year” instantly became a thing of the past.

With the way Stony Brook continues to bring in high-level talent, it seems likely the program will have its day soon enough. But for now, Seawolves fans will just have to “wait ’til next year.”

A 21st-century Stony Brook stage was transformed into 17th-century Spain when the Moscow City Ballet performed “Don Quixote” on the Staller Center Main Stage on Saturday, March 14 at 8 p.m..

The ballet is loosely based on the 1605 novel of the same name by Miguel de Cervantes, which also served as the inspiration for the musical “Man of La Mancha.” The ballet tells the tale of the pretend knight-errant Don Quixote (Alexander Gavrilov), who embarks on a chivalrous quest to find his imaginary love, Dulcinea.

While Don Quixote’s character is the comedic heart of the story, the true stars of the ballet are the lovers Kitri and Basil, whom the knight meets on his quest. Don Quixote becomes determined to unite the two when they are kept apart by Kitri’s father, who wants her to marry the rich but vain Gamash.

The Moscow City Ballet took the audience to many locations, including a lively town square, a forest with glittering tree nymphs in tutus and a raucous tavern. The play ended with a romantic and daring pas de deux<i>, </i>a duet by a male and female dancer.

The production starred Yulia Zhuravleva as the flirtatious Kitri and Talgat Kozhabaev as the charming Basil. The audience cheered as Zhuravleva performed the famous fouetté en tournant<i>,</i> turning on one leg 32 times without stopping. Kozhabaev showed his own technical prowess when he performed two swan dives, lifting Zhuravleva up without using his arms—only his waist and his hip.

“They are simply superb,” the company’s director Ilina Dubovskaya said, with tour manager Nadia Fleishaker serving as a translator. “They are very emotional, and they are highly professional. The stars sometimes perform with this company and sometimes perform as stars in Bolshoi and Mariinsky and all different leading companies.”

Don Quixote’s “squire” Sancho Panza (Valerii Kravtsov), Kitri’s father Lorenzo (Yaroslav Alkhnovich) and Gamash (Dmitriy Trukhachev) kept the audience laughing with over-the-top pantomime. Rounding out the cast were Liliya Orekhova as the Queen of the Dryads, Maria Khrapova as Cupid, and Anna Ivanova and Kateryna Tokareva as Kitri’s friends.

The corps de ballet, or the supporting dance ensemble, dazzled in colorful period costumes, such as red-blooded matadors with sweeping capes and seductive street dancers with hand-held fans. Although the ensemble performed to pre-recorded tracks, they added some live music by playing tambourines and castanets on stage.

“The company comes before each performance at least for 7, 8 hours before,” Dubovskaya said. “They do the whole class which takes almost two hours, and they do rehearse the performance.”

The Moscow City Ballet was founded in 1988 by Victor Smirnov-Golovanov as the first private Russian ballet company in the Soviet Union.

The choreography for “Don Quixote,” which was created by Marius Petipa for its 1869 premiere, was updated by Smirnov-Golovanov for his own company. Ludmila Nerubachtchenko took over as artistic director of the Moscow City Ballet after Smirnov-Golovanov, her husband, died in 2013.

Dubovskaya said the dancers keep to Smirnov-Golovanov’s choreography as a tribute to him.

“Don Quixote” is a ballet combined the Russian dance style and the music of Austrian composer Ludwig Minkus, along with Spanish flair and flavor.

“[The dancers] try to keep the same traditions,” Dubovskaya said. “They never change, and they like this choreography because it’s more dynamic and more unique.”

The company tours across Europe, Asia and South America, but this year’s tour marks the first time in 15 years that company has performed in the United States, Dubovskaya said.

“This is another opportunity to be in this beautiful country and to enjoy the audience and the country,” she said.

Fleishaker said the dancers of the Moscow City Ballet particularly enjoy performing for American audiences.

“A lot of company members told me that American audiences were the best because it’s a little bit different,” Fleishaker said. “It’s warmer and more exciting. They love American audiences.”]]></content:encoded>

The Seawolves would go on to win the matchup against the Jacksonville Dolphins 13-4. <em>STATESMAN STOCK PHOTO</em>[/caption]

At first glance, the box score may indicate that Stony Brook women’s lacrosse had stiff competition in Jacksonville on Sunday afternoon. After all, the home Dolphins squad led in faceoffs 11-8, led in ground ball scoops 18-16 and had an equal number of fouls drawn (23-23).

Yet on this day, offensive execution mattered far more than possession numbers. The Seawolves were able to cruise to a 13-4 victory to bring their seasonal record to a perfect 5-0.

The 18th-ranked Seawolves were led by sophomore attacker Courtney Murphy, who had six goals and an assist on the afternoon. It was the sixth double hat trick of Murphy’s young SBU career and her first of the season.

Also contributing to the offense were sophomore midfielder Dorrien Van Dyke and senior midfielder Michelle Rubino, who each had two goals. Rubino added a game-high three assists and three draws controlled for the Seawolves.

Stony Brook started the game on a 3-0 run within the opening four minutes of the first half and never looked back. All game long, the Seawolves offense was moving the ball around and shooting at a high percentage. Stony Brook had a shooting percentage of 65 percent on the game, compared to just a 22 percent shooting percentage for Jacksonville.

The defense for the Seawolves was superb once again. The Dolphins entered the game averaging 15.3 goals per game, the eighth-highest scoring team in the nation, but they were simply stifled by the back lines of Stony Brook on Sunday.

The Seawolves have not allowed an opposing offense to score more than six goals in any game this season.

Sophomore goalkeeper Kaitlyn Leahy stopped five of nine shots she faced in the game, with the defense forcing Jacksonville to miss the net completely on an additional nine shots.

Sally Holbert scored twice for Jacksonville, which drops to 6-2 this season with the loss.

On Tuesday, Stony Brook travels south within Florida from Jacksonville to Gainesville to play against the No. 6 Florida Gators. The Gators defeated the Seawolves 14-1 at Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium in the largest home loss of the Joe Spallina-era in their meeting last season.]]></content:encoded>

The Great Danes would take the match 17-15. <em>CHRISTOPHER CAMERON / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

On Saturday, the Stony Brook men’s lacrosse team was given a chance to avenge its heartbreaking overtime loss to the Albany Great Danes in last year’s championship game. While the Seawolves showed positive signs of competitiveness against the reigning champs, they were unable to find a lead and lost, 17-15.

“Hats off to them. They are the defending champs of the league. I think we have a real strong team and leadership but they got into that and rattled us a little bit,” Stony Brook Head Coach Jim Nagle said of the game.

With the starting face-off just minutes away, rain came down at Kenneth P. LaValle stadium leaving the field slick and wet. Players lined up and readied themselves for the first whistle. A few moments later, the first goal was scored.

A quick win by Albany in the faceoff circle provided Lyle Thompson with the ball and a clear path to Stony Brook’s zone. In a matter of seconds, Thompson advanced the ball, spotted a teammate located backdoor of the Seawolves goal and weaved a pass to his teammate Connor Russell, who then put it away eight seconds into the game.

“Oh yeah, he is an unreal player. All you can really say about that,” Stony Brook’s Brody Eastwood said of Thompson.

The quick sequence by Thompson and Russell seemed to startle the Seawolves, who had trouble adjusting to the aggressive play of the Great Danes. The Danes' aggressive mentality would lead Albany to an 11-6 edge early in the third quarter.

It was at this point that junior midfielder Mike Rooney kick started the Seawolves by scoring an unassisted goal and signaling the start of a run that brought the game even. The offensive run had Stony Brook outscoring Albany 7-2 and ended the third quarter tied 13-13. Rooney would finish the game with five goals and four assists, totaling nine points on the day.

“We started to play our offense while in the first half we weren’t clicking, we weren’t playing our game. The second half we started to do that and take it possession by possession, one goal at a time,” Rooney said of their comeback after a slow start.

Unfortunately, the comeback ended with the third quarter and as the fourth quarter began, Albany was on the man advantage. It was this penalty that do allowed the Wildcats to score two goals that doomed the Seawolves.

Stony Brook would cut the deficit to one goal for a few minutes, but was never able to tie it up again. Instead, Albany played stiff defense and kept a two-goal cushion for most of the quarter.

Eastwood had himself a nice game, hitting the back of the net four times and scoring four of Stony Brook’s first six goals. He now has 19 goals this year and is on pace to match his personal career-high single-season record of 44 goals.

Even with the performances from Rooney and Eastwood, it was Albany’s midfielder Thompson who stole the show Saturday afternoon. From the first whistle to the last, he was the best player on the field. While scoring only two goals, he set up nearly every other goal, adding ten assists to his stat line and completed the day with 12 points.

“We are a much better team than we have been and one of the things I know about this team, the leadership is tremendous. So I know we are going to work and get better as the season goes on,” Nagle said, “We are going to be a better team next week and the week after that. The future is bright.”

Stony Brook will look to get better and rebound from its conference opening loss on Saturday afternoon at 1 p.m.. The game will be played at LaValle Stadium against the UMBC Retrievers.]]></content:encoded>

This will be the fourth-straight season that the Seawolves will participate in a postseason tournament. <em>HEATHER KHALIFA / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

Stony Brook's NCAA Tournament hopes may have come to a heartbreaking end on Saturday, but the Seawolves will still get the opportunity to participate in a postseason tournament this week.

For the second straight year the SBU men's basketball team has accepted an invitation to play in the College Basketball Invitational (CBI).  The Seawolves will face off against the Mercer Bears this Wednesday at 7 p.m. in Macon, Georgia.

This is the fourth-straight season Stony Brook will play in a postseason tournament. The team earned berths in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) in both 2012 and 2013, and took part in the CBI for the first time last season.

The Seawolves suffered an early exit in last year's CBI, when they lost in the opening round to Siena.

Mercer will also be making its fourth-straight appearance in a postseason tournament. The Bears were able to upset No. 3 Duke in last year's NCAA Tournament.

This season, Mercer had a record of 18-15 (12-6 in Southern Conference play). The team lost in the Southern Conference semifinals to Furman, 52-46.

The Bears are led by senior Darious Moten and junior Ike Nwamu, who both earned spots this season on the All-Southern Conference team. Moten, however, will not play against the Seawolves after getting hurt in the team's victory in its conference quarterfinals matchup against VMI.

If Stony Brook is able to take down Mercer, the Seawolves will advance to play the winner of Eastern Michigan-Louisiana Monroe matchup on March 23.

A pair of Seawolves' rivals will also be facing off in the first round of the CBI. On Wednesday night, Hofstra will play host to Vermont.

The Seawolves lost to the Pride, 66-65, back on Nov. 21. SBU also lost to conference foe Vermont twice during the regular season before defeating the Catamounts in the semi-finals of the America East tournament.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The attorney representing the State University of New York in the <a href="http://sbstatesman.com/2015/03/12/sarah-speaks-plaintiff-in-sexual-assault-case-addresses-flaws-in-stony-brook-judiciary-system/">Sarah Tubbs lawsuit</a> has filed a request for a pre-motion conference<strong>—</strong>a request that states Tubbs’s complaint should be dismissed.

State Assistant Attorney General Mark Klein filed the request on March 12. Judge Nelson Roman of the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, approved the request for the conference, which is scheduled for March 25. In a pre-motion conference, the judge and lawyers in a civil lawsuit discuss what motion a party plans to file and the opposing party's response to the motion.

Klein’s request also states that because Stony Brook University is not a “legally-cognizable entity separate from SUNY,” SUNY has taken Stony Brook University’s place as the defendant in the lawsuit.

<a href="http://sbstatesman.com/2015/02/03/sbu-faces-lawsuit-for-deliberate-indifference-in-allegedly-mishandling-sexual-assault-case/">Tubbs filed a lawsuit against Stony Brook University</a> on Jan. 23, 2015 for “deliberate indifference” regarding<b> </b>the manner in which the administration allegedly handled her complaint of sexual assault under Title IX. Title IX is the federal clause that prohibits discrimination based on sex at any federally-funded educational institution.

"The University is unable to comment on specific litigation, as Federal privacy laws prohibit us from disclosing student information," SBU Media Relations Officer Lauren Sheprow said in an email. "The court will have the opportunity to consider the full record, including information we cannot immediately share publicly."

<i>The Statesman</i> is publishing Tubbs’s name with her expressed permission to do so.

Klein’s request cites the standard for student-on-student harassment set by the 2013 lawsuit <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10793852326866177494">KF v. Monroe Woodbury Central School District</a>. Judge Edgardo Ramos, also a judge of the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, presided over the KF lawsuit. Sussman &amp; Watkins, the law firm that is representing Tubbs, also represented the plaintiffs in the KF lawsuit.

The court’s opinion in the KF lawsuit states that “Title IX funding recipients may be held liable for student-on-student harassment if the plaintiff can establish damages only where the school district: (1) was deliberately indifferent; (2) to sexual harassment; (3) of which it had actual knowledge; (4) that was so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it deprived the victim of access to the educational opportunities or 10 benefits provided by the school.”

The opinion for the KF lawsuit cites the 1999 lawsuit <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1286413030321424251">Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education</a>, the opinion for which states that deliberate indifference must “at a minimum, cause students to undergo harassment or make them liable or vulnerable to it.”

“Accordingly, even accepting as true plaintiff’s [Tubbs's] allegations that SUNY’s response to plaintiff’s<b> </b>[Tubbs's] claims was deficient, plaintiff’s [Tubbs's] allegations nonetheless fail to support any assertion that SUNY effectively <i>caused</i> plaintiff to encounter discrimination,” Klein’s request states.

According to Tubbs’s lawsuit complaint, she reported her alleged sexual assault to Stony Brook’s Office of University Community Standards, which scheduled the disciplinary hearing during her final exams, less than a week before her graduation ceremony in the spring of 2014.

Tubbs was allegedly informed “she would be responsible for prosecuting her case” during the hearing. Both Tubbs’s complaint and <a href="http://sbstatesman.com/2015/03/12/defendant-in-sexual-assault-trial-seeks-10-million-for-alleged-slander-and-libel/">her alleged assailant’s counterclaim</a> state that Tubbs and the alleged assailant were separated by a paper screen during the hearing.

“Despite the presence of the screen, nothing could address the trauma of having to question, and be questioned by, this man,” Tubbs’s complaint states.

On May 22, 2014, the day of her first graduation ceremony, Tubbs was informed the alleged assailant was found not responsible. After receiving the written basis for the hearing panel’s decision, dated July 9, 2014, Tubbs filed an appeal.

In a letter dated Aug. 28, 2014, Director of Campus Recreation Jay Souza allegedly advised her that after reviewing the case, he “found no evidence that the Hearing Board considered the definition of consent found in the University Code of Conduct and/or applied that definition to the facts of this case” and that the finding “constitutes a significant procedural error warranting the granting of your appeal.”

Tubbs’s complaint states she was notified she would be contacted by the Office of University Community Standards with the next steps in the process, but no university official provided any “substantive response” or further steps.

Tubbs’ lawyer, Amy Attias of Sussman and Watkins, said in a meeting with media representatives that on March 6, 2015, Tubbs received an email from Stony Brook University’s Director of the Office of Community Standards Matty Orlich stating that the appeal was found against Tubbs.

The senior shutout Morgan State in five innings, allowing only one hit while striking out three.  <em>STATESMAN STOCK PHOTO</em>[/caption]

The Stony Brook softball team came away with a pair of wins this Sunday at Manhattan College as the Seawolves blew past both Morgan State in a 15-0 shutout and Mount St. Mary’s in a 3-2, eight-inning bout. Outfielder Bria Green went a combined 7-for-8 with two home runs and four RBIs in the two games.

The result of SBU's game against Morgan State was expected from early on in the game. The blowout win for Stony Brook began with an RBI triple by Shayla Giosia in the top of the first inning, plating Alexandra Pisciotta. The Seawolves scored another run in the first, but were not near finished. A five-run, seven-hit second inning quickly brought the score to 7-0, with help from a Giosia three-run homer. Stony Brook scored two more runs in the third as Green hit her first home run of the day, a solo shot to the left.

The Seawolves put the nail in the coffin in the top of the fifth, as they plated six runners on six hits, bringing the score to a whopping 15-0. Senior Lauren Kamachi knocked in three of the six runs with a homer to left. Stony Brook’s batting invoked the mercy rule after the bottom of the fifth inning. Giosia had a field day with Morgan State's pitching, going 3-for-3 with a home run, a triple and six RBIs.

Despite an overpowering offensive performance, the real story of the game was Allison Cukrov’s near-perfect outing. She pitched five shutout innings, allowing just a single hit and two walks throughout the whole game.

The Bears used four pitchers in total, allowing a combined 15 runs, 16 hits, two walks and three strikeouts.

The Seawolves' second game that day was much closer than their first. Stony Brook got out to a 1-0 lead in the top of the fourth inning off the bat of a solo shot by Lexie Shue. Mount St. Mary's answered quickly, plating two runners in the bottom of the inning to give them a 2-1 lead.

In the top of the fifth, Kamachi would tie the game for the Seawolves with an RBI single, sending Green to the plate. The score would remain the same until the eighth inning, when Chelsea Evans scored on an error by the right fielder.

Jane Sallen started on the mound for Stony Brook, pitching six impressive innings. She gave up two runs on five hits, one walk and five strikeouts. Cukrov came in for relief, closing out the game with two scoreless innings. She allowed only one hit and fanned three.

Marian Ruf got the nod for Mount St. Mary’s. She allowed three runs on 11 hits, three walks and four strikeouts through eight innings of work.

SBU was originally scheduled to play a doubleheader at Seton Hall on Tuesday, but the two games were postponed. Next up on the schedule for the Seawolves is a road matchup against LIU Brooklyn, which will take place on Wednesday at 4 p.m.. America East conference play will begin this weekend, as Stony Brook hosts a three-game set against UMass-Lowell this Saturday and Sunday.]]></content:encoded>

Looking to avenge last season’s 14-1 demolition at the hands of the Florida Gators, the Seawolves knew it would be a difficult fight on the road against the No. 6 team in the nation.

Just five minutes into Tuesday evening’s game, sophomore goalkeeper Kaitlyn Leahy was already pulling the ball out of her own net for a fourth time. As the Stony Brook women’s lacrosse team peered out to the Gainesville scoreboard, they saw an early three-goal deficit.

It may have seemed like the team was en route to another long night, unable to compete with its SEC foes. In previous seasons, the team has shown dominance in the America East, but failed to ever win against one of the nation’s elite, nary a single victory over a top-ten team in program history.

Things would be different this time. The Seawolves showcased that they can not only compete with the nation's best but beat the nation's best, defeating the Gators 12-11 on Tuesday night.

For the remainder of the first half, Joe Spallina’s defense demonstrated their brilliance, stifling all Florida attacks with the utmost discipline. Stony Brook committed just three fouls in the half, and led the Gators 8-6 in ground balls.

Offensively, the Seawolves excelled in transition, turning Gator turnovers into goals at the other end. When freshman Kylie Ohlmiller snapped home a goal just 16 seconds before the intermission, Stony Brook was on a 4-0 run and took a 5-4 lead at the horn, silencing the Gator faithful.

In the second half, both teams were able to find some more offense. Stony Brook opened up a 9-6 lead with 17:15 remaining after another Ohlmiller score. From there, it seemed as if ever time the Gators started to rally, the Seawolves had an answer. Florida cut the lead to 10-9, 11-10 and 12-11, but was never able to find the equalizer.

Senior Amber Kupres took a charge for Stony Brook with 59 seconds left to play, and the team was able to stall the next minute to advance to 6-0, having completed the most impressive win in school history.

St. Patrick’s Day is known for many things: wearing green, Irish parades and adults getting sozzled during the daytime, but for the members of this lacrosse team, it will be a day remembered as when they defeated a sixth-ranked team, on the road, to collect a signature win to put themselves on the map nationally.

Ohlmiller had five goals and added an assist to lead all scorers for the Seawolves. Sophomore Courtney Murphy also had a hat trick for Stony Brook and senior Michelle Rubino had two goals, one assist and six draw controls.

The Gators had three goals each from Mollie Stevens, Nora Barry and Devon Schneider, as the team fell to 6-4 on the season.

Conference play begins for Stony Brook this Saturday, as the Seawolves will play on the road against the New Hampshire. The Wildcats have a 3-5 record and have not beaten the Seawolves since 2011.]]></content:encoded>

The Stony Brook women’s lacrosse team may have proved people wrong on Tuesday night, but the Seawolves also proved themselves right in believing they could compete with powerhouse lacrosse programs from across the country, beating the No. 6 Florida Gators in Gainesville, 12-11.

It was anything but an ordinary win for the Seawolves in more ways than one. On Monday, Head Coach Joe Spallina and his clan welcomed a seventh member to their family, his second daughter, Olivia Meredith. As the Spallina family stayed behind watching from afar, he headed south to the swamp for a battle at Donald R. Dizney Stadium.

Stony Brook looked to reverse the fortunes of their 14-1 loss against the Gators at Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium last season.

They were out to prove people wrong.

Tewaaraton Award finalist Shannon Gilroy, a senior midfielder for Florida, led the charge against the Seawolves after wreaking havoc last year. But this time, Spallina’s team was ready. It was time to make a statement.

For all the hype that surrounded the Seawolves when one of the best goalies in the country, Frankie Caridi, wore Stony Brook red, the team never quite broke through. Back-to-back second round appearances in the NCAA Tournament were major accomplishments for the team and the program as a whole, but as the national powerhouses like Florida confronted them, Spallina’s team fell short. Not anymore.

If beating the Gators proved anything, it was showing those powerhouses that the Seawolves will not fold in the big moments against the very best. Stony Brook already knew what it could do, but the team wanted to do something else.

Prove people wrong.

Kylie Ohlmiller tossed five into the back of Florida’s cage, bringing her to 26 points on the still-young season and backing up what has been high praise from Spallina. After a scoreless first game of the year in which her first career goal was called off for an illegal stick, the freshman has been the best player on the team, not only scoring but creating opportunities for others. It goes without saying that her performance was key in earning the huge spring break-win.

The Seawolves had not done it before, nor did many people outside the program believe it either.

Prove people wrong. That has been this team’s motto all season long.

A win against an annual contender in Notre Dame at home got things off on the right foot, and a victory against a dangerous Jacksonville squad on their turf continued the trend.

Stony Brook does not have to prove people wrong anymore. The 6-0 start to the season has shown the Seawolves' talent and depth all over the field, including in net where sophomore Kaitlyn Leahy has had the unenviable task of picking up where Caridi left off.

There were question marks early on in the journey about how quickly the team’s offense could mesh, with a lot of pieces trying to fit together into one difficult puzzle to deal with. 12 goals against a team that has made at least the quarterfinals of the NCAA Tournament in each of the last four years shows that when things are working, that is not a problem.

The Seawolves can play, and not just with the America East, but the country.

People used to say that this was a defensive-minded squad relying on letting Caridi save the day. Stony Brook is still strong on the defensive end without their former netminder, but they have become a potent force on the offensive end as well.

Any team that has the nation’s two-leading scorers for freshmen in Courtney Murphy and Dorrien Van Dyke, a talent like Ohlmiller and Virginia-transfer Taylor Ranftle could make things happen.

That does not even point out the fact that 2014's 22-goal scorer Kristin Yevoli does not start. This team may not have a modern-day version of assistant coach Demmianne Cook, who scored 90 goals in 2013, but it has depth that will only grow, as much of the team has plenty of time left on Long Island.

The No. 17/14 Seawolves will more than likely move up in the rankings next week with one of the program’s biggest wins to date, and that could mean more than a victory would for a Stony Brook team. As the Seawolves climb their way up the ladder, they will find themselves in a better position at the end of the year if they should not secure the America East’s automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament.

One thing that Spallina said before the season even started, though, is that there is something the team needs drastic improvement in: the draw control. If it were not for Florida turnovers late in the second half that were caused by a highly-pressuring Stony Brook defense, the Gators could have executed to tie the game.

It was a good sign to see the Seawolves win the battle in the draw circle against Notre Dame, but getting doubled up in the second half by Florida made a great performance more nerve-wracking than it could have been.

When Stony Brook wins in the draw control department, not only are they able to take its time executing in the offensive third, but it gives the Seawolves' strong defense time to rest up for the oncoming attack.

Last but certainly not least has been the performance of senior two-way midfielder Michelle Rubino. The story used to be that her play may not show up in the statistics as much as the rest of the team. Her nine goals and three assists may disagree.

It may not seem like much compared to Ohlmiller and Murphy’s numbers, but it is really quite simple. Rubino does everything. Nobody on the team causes more turnovers, wreaks more of a havoc in the ground ball game or is in the opposing goalies face as they are attempting to clear, only to fly to the other end to make a crucial defensive play. That does not even touch her responsibilities in the draw control department, where she flings up and has caught 13 draws herself.

It is as if Rubino is the shine that makes this Seawolves painting a masterpiece. It is still early in the season, but having such a young team performing at their current level only leaves one wondering what could come next.

Ask Spallina and company, though, and they will not be thinking about that, nor the opening of their America East slate on Saturday at New Hampshire. The team instead heads back to Long Island to celebrate the addition of someone to what matters most for the Seawolves: family.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>&quot;To Pimp a Butterfly&quot; marks Kendrick Lamar&#039;s second classic album</title>

Kendrick Lamar is good at three things: storytelling, spoken word poetry and churning out classic albums.  His latest album, “To Pimp a Butterfly,” is his second instant classic to come out of the studio and his best album yet. While it is devoid of any club bangers, the album does present an intellectual commentary about society, race and the division between good and evil.

The first four songs on the album present genius thoughts on race, wealth, the celebration of yourself and the hood, but in order to understand the album, you need to look at the fifth track, "These Walls."  The track is the thesis of the album.  In it, Lamar describes the complexities of trying to fit life into the duality of good and evil.  He asks himself if he really is the hero that many describe him as.  He asks himself if the conflict in his life is worth it.  He asks himself the questions that drive the album. This idea of confusion is central to the album's theme—Lamar does not have the answers himself, but he has the questions.

The theme culminates at the end of the album's outro "Mortal Man." On the track Lamar has a conversation with the man he calls his hero and inspiration, the late Tupac Shakur, and asks him about race, rap and life.  Lamar finishes the spoken word poem that he had been reciting in part for the majority of the album. He relates it back to a Shakur metaphor about good and evil. Shakur's response, lifted from an interview he did two weeks before the infamous Quad Recording Studio shooting, is the perfect end for the album. He answers all of Lamar's questions, but then disappears when Lamar asks him a question that his friend wrote. Lamar's mentor, hero and influence gives him the answers to the questions that have been driving the album. It is a genius move by a genius artist.

"Versatile" is an understatement when it comes to describing Lamar's flow. In the track "u," he uses three flows alone. The production on the album demands this type of versatility. When you have a set of funk inspired tracks, such as "King Kunta" and "Wesley's Theory," you cannot rap the same way you would on a track that sounds much more like a traditional rap song, such as "Hood Politics." Lamar shines on both, sounding like a veteran who has been rapping for decades even though “To Pimp a Butterfly” is only his second album.

The only problem with “To Pimp a Butterfly” is that it lacks a certain smoothness.  He takes risks with his flow and delivery that are somewhat unnecessary.  In the track "Momma," he skirts around the beat, which was an odd move.  It just seemed out of place when most of the album was Lamar rapping on beat.  Also, the lack of a "banger" is disappointing.  On his first major release "good kid, m.A.A.d city," we saw songs that were destined to be chart toppers like "Swimming Pools (Drank)" and "Backstreet Freestyle."  Most of the production in "To Pimp a Butterfly" does not allow a banger. Rather, the funk inspired production moves away from the speaker blaring tracks that were expected.

Another concern with the album is the fact that it seems out of context with most of Lamar's actions since the release of his previous album.  After "good kid, m.A.A.d city, we saw Lamar claim the crown as King of New York and call out most of the popular rappers post-2010 in Big Sean's "Control."  He then proceeded to insult Drake during Top Dawg Entertainment's rap cypher at the B.E.T. Hip Hop Awards in 2013.  The sudden 180 degree turn from dominating every rapper he sees to caring about society and goodness is just odd. It seemed very out of character for Lamar.

If we consider “good Kid, m.A.A.d city” to be Lamar's version of "Illmatic," which is regarded as the greatest rap album ever recorded, then "To Pimp a Butterfly" sets a new precedent in terms of quality. In regards to lyrical content and complexity, the album is simply levels above Lamar's previous efforts and efforts by other rappers. Due to the lack of a banger and the fact that the subject matter is extremely deep, this album is not fun to listen to. But even as such, this album is not only Lamar's best album so far, but might just be the best rap album of 2015.]]></content:encoded>

The Seawolves suffered a heartbreaking defeat against Albany in the America East Championship game and again in the College Basketball Invitational against Mercer. Both losses saw their opponents score on last-second shots.
<p dir="ltr">Stony Brook dealt with a serious case of déjà vu in its first-round College Basketball Invitational matchup with Mercer, falling at the hands of Ike Nwamu’s game-winner with 1.2 seconds to go.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With the game tied at 70 after a missed Carson Puriefoy-free throw, Nwamu drove on Kameron Mitchell and pulled up from short range, icing the winner on a friendly bounce and finishing the game with 25 points.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Seawolves turned it over on the ensuing inbounds pass to lose 72-70, ending their season on back-to-back losses that came as the result of last-second shots.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The same problem that plagued SBU <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_95965219"><span class="aQJ">on Saturday</span></span> against Albany hurt them at Mercer, with just 11-of-19 shooting from the free throw stripe and two crucial misses late. Nwamu scored 14 of Mercer’s final 16 points after  the game remained neck-and-neck throughout. In a minute-and-a-half long stretch with under three to play, both teams answered each other’s jumpers in what resembled an all-star game shootout.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Puriefoy led the way for the Seawolves with 19 points on 6-of-16 shooting. Mitchell scored 15 points on 4-of-5 shooting from three, a new career-high for the sophomore. Jameel Warney added 14 points and 13 rebounds, his 24th double-double of the season.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Neither squad led by more than six points in what turned into a barnburner in the second half. Stony Brook scored 43 points to Mercer’s 45 in the latter period.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Head Coach Steve Pikiell played everybody on his team save for Ryan Burnett, but just two players shot above 50 percent on the night. Offensive rebounds and threes kept Stony Brook afloat offensively against Mercer’s 1-3-1 zone and undersized lineups, while the Seawolves’ defense struggled.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mercer committed 15 turnovers, but connected on 45 percent of its field goals and shot 8-of-21 from downtown. Roland Nyama’s defense was missed as he was not on the team bench in the second half due to an illness.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stony Brook’s season now comes to an end after consecutive heartbreakers in the closing seconds. While fans clamor to soak up all the March Madness they can, the Seawolves must wait another year to try and finally overcome the March Sadness that has cursed them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The win came after a loss to the Binghamton Bearcats the day before. <em>MEGAN MILLER / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

Due in part to the string of bad weather, the Stony Brook baseball team pounded out four games in three days, coming out victorious in 75 percent of its contests.

The first three, which took place as part of a doubleheader on Sunday and a Monday afternoon tilt, saw the Seawolves sweep the Binghamton Bearcats in their America East season opener. The next day, the Bearcats got out of town with a lone victory.

To top it off, the Seawolves ran over the Iona Gaels on Tuesday by a final of 11-2.

As Mother Nature once again intervened on Saturday, the doubleheader that was scheduled to open the Seawolves’ America East conference schedule had to be moved back to Sunday. The extra day of wait showed no ill effects for starting pitcher Tyler Honahan, who mowed through the visiting Bearcats.

Going seven strong innings of scoreless baseball, Honahan struck out five while allowing just three hits and three walks, but most importantly, he prevented any runners from crossing the plate.

It took until the bottom of the fifth for the Stony Brook bats to wake up, finally seizing the moment to strike. Junior outfielder Jack Parenty broke the deadlock with a two-RBI, bases-loaded single. It would be Parenty’s only knock of the day, but it brought the floodgates crashing down.

The final nail in the coffin came right after the seventh inning stretch, when the Bearcats quite literally gave the first half of the doubleheader away. As Binghamton made three errors in the field, the Seawolves would have four runs cross the plate on just two hits, ballooning their lead to 7-0.

Junior Chad Lee would allow three runs in the top half of the ninth to keep from shutting out the Bearcats, but he would have his redemption later in the week.

In the front end of the doubleheader, the Seawolves cruised to an 8-3 victory before strapping them back up and coming out to play game two.

The second contest would feature another Seawolves win, this time by a closer margin of 6-3.

Up until the bottom of the fifth, the two teams were locked up at three, neither willing to budge. But senior catcher Cole Peragine’s bases-loaded walk and freshman first baseman Andruw Gazzola’s two-RBI single put Stony Brook ahead for good.

Vital in securing the lead in the afternoon affair, freshman left-hander Kevin Kernan came in as relief in the top of the sixth inning to induce a double play with the bases loaded to escape a Bearcats threat. Reaping the benefits was sophomore starting pitcher Daniel Zamora, who picked up the victory.

Freshman Gazzola continued to make his transition to the collegiate level look seamless, as he reached base in six of his seven plate appearances. The left-handed batting first baseman stroked four hits to go along with two walks during Sunday’s doubleheader.

For as well as Sunday went for the Seawolves, they were blown off the field on Monday afternoon by a ferocious Bearcats club by a final of 13-2.

In pursuit of his first victory of the season, junior right-hander Tim Knesnik suffered the brunt of the Bearcats’ frustration. Recording just eight outs on the afternoon, he would allow eight runs (five of which were earned) on six hits and one walk, while striking out none.

Striking for three runs in the top of the first, the Binghamton onslaught would only truly emerge come the top of the third. With Stony Brook trailing 3-1, there was certainly no reason to believe the game would be out of reach anytime soon. But more than a half-hour later, the Bearcats were still hitting and it seemed it may never end.

Going for 10 runs on nine hits and an error, the Bearcats opened up a commanding 13-1 lead that the Seawolves never really had a chance to answer back from.

In relief of Knesnik was freshman right-hander Nicholas DiEva, who could not escape the Bearcats rapture either. While he would go 3.1 innings of not allowing an earned run, he would be responsible for being on the mound while the Bearcats hammered away any remaining hope for Stony Brook, scoring five unearned runs and pounding out seven hits. DiEva would also strikeout four and walk two, but at that point, the damage had been done.

After posting a gaudy .980 field percentage last season, sophomore shortstop Jeremy Giles had a tough go of it in the field, committing two errors on Sunday alone. The error plague was widespread, as even Peragine committed one behind the dish.

A day after getting bludgeoned, the Seawolves did some swinging of their own. Blowing the doors off the Iona Gaels, Stony Brook cruised to an 11-2 win on Tuesday afternoon.

All nine Seawolves starters would collect at least a single hit, led by junior third baseman Johnny Caputo, who would go 3-for-4 with three RBIs to pace Stony Brook.

The offensive explosion may in part have something to do with the switching of the batting order prior to Tuesday’s contest (or the fact that the Gaels were 3-15 on the season entering the game). Peragine found himself in the leadoff spot, collecting a multi-hit game, while junior second baseman Robert Chavarria also had two hits, driving in a pair of runs from the cleanup spot.

Gazzola posted a remarkable .538 (7-for-13) average for the four games, including two walks, to lead an offense that broke out in a much needed way.

With it being the Seawolves’ fourth game in three days due to the constricted schedule, their pitching staff was improvised on the fly. Normally coming out of the bullpen, junior right-hander Lee got the start and tossed three perfect innings while his offense scored him eight runs of support. It gave him his first win since 2013, when he was a freshman.

Also contributing to the effort were sophomore Cameron Stone, freshman Cole Creighton, senior Nick Brass and freshman Teddy Rodliff, who polished off the final six innings while allowing just three hits and two runs as a group.

There will be no rest for the weary Seawolves, who will have a quick turnaround and welcome in the Creighton Blue Jays on Friday afternoon for the start of a three-game series.]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Stony Brook University Office of Sustainability, the Department of Energy Management and Division of Campus Residences have worked together to implement a Building Dashboard system that allows the university community to view energy consumption for each campus building.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The system gives information on electricity, solar electricity, steam, chilled water, natural gas, recycling statistics and sustainability for each of the more than 120 building energy meters.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Last spring, we partnered with an outside company in order to help us display a few different things specifically utility and energy consumption information as well as sustainability information in order to get that content from building meters and try to get that information out to the general public,” James O’Connor, the director of Sustainability and Transportation Operations, said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Building Dashboard system offers users an easy-to-navigate and interactive system.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“It’s really easy to interpret, and that was something we talked about that we wanted because not everyone’s an expert on this,” Gregory Monaco, the Sustainability coordinator, said. “For our community to be able to look at it and understand exactly what it’s saying is huge. So no matter where you are if you are able to look at the dashboard and take the information and then hopefully change some things to make it better. Everyone wins.”</span></p>


[caption id="attachment_37637" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/electricity-chart-011.png"><img class="size-half-width wp-image-37637" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/electricity-chart-011-300x356.png" alt="ADAM POLLACK / THE STATESMAN" width="300" height="356" /></a> ADAM POLLACK / THE STATESMAN[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The system also allows users to change units of measurement. In January, Stony Brook consumed 15,450,479 kWh of electricity, which is equivalent to 458,416 gallons of gasoline, 4,075,836 hamburgers cooked or 540,767 laptops powered.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“It has very user-friendly icons on it its very graphic intensive, so it’s made for really anybody who’s not a energy professional to be able to look and view energy consumption and recycling as well as sustainability,” O’Connor said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last April, Stony Brook finished second in the Campus Conservation Nationals event against the University at Albany, SUNY IT and SUNY New Paltz. SBU saved a total of 41,081 kilowatt-hours and over $6,500 in utility savings during the “Wolfie Unplugged” event.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We run a competition for a month and we get the building occupants engaged in conservation measures so what that means is maybe they’ll turn off lights for that month in their office, maybe they’ll choose to recycle more in their office, maybe they’ll also do other things if they’re living on campus, like take shorter showers,” O’Connor said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Office of Sustainability organized another “Wolfie Unplugged” competition between 13 campus buildings last November.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The competition resulted in Melville Library reducing its energy consumption by over 21.6 percent to earn first place among academic buildings.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“When we met with student organizations for the “Wolfie Unplugged” competition they seemed to like the way it operated and looked and the feel of it,” Monaco said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Office of Sustainability intends to add incentives to the next energy competition happening in October.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Maybe students would receive incentives or the buildings would receive incentives, something like a sustainability makeover to a winning building. So that a building might receive additional water bottle filling stations, they may receive a bike share station outside of the building, or they may receive electric hand dryers in the restrooms instead of using paper towels,” O’Connor said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Building Dashboard system will help Stony Brook achieve “a New York State requirement that we have to lower our energy by 20 percent between the years of 2010 and 2020. We also have to lower our carbon footprint by 25 percent starting from the year 2008 to 2020,” O’Connor said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Office of Sustainability also plans to increase awareness of the Building Dashboard by displaying it on the LED boards across campus.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We’re starting to tailor displays for specific buildings so you’ll see a lot more of this service on the LED boards,” O’Connor said. “The campus has over 200 boards total. And our goal is to continue to add the Building Dashboard to these boards. We also want to better promote and engage the community.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We need to have these types of services, which is why the building dashboard is here, so that now people are aware of it think about it and then apply it their behavior,” O’Connor said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

This feature is exclusive to the app and allows for personalization. <em>NATHALY SIERRA / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1">The new SB Guardian App is now available for all Stony Brook students, showcasing new personal safety features to keep students connected with people they trust.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The app is free for iPhones and Androids. This is the first downloadable app for safety available to Stony Brook University students. Previously, students were able to sign up for Guardian alerts via email and text message.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The University Police Department recently announced this new app in its September
2014 newsletter.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The registration used to be cumbersome,” Assistant to the Director of University Police Jason Casale said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Casale said according to a report, about 600 students have downloaded the app. Besides sending out an email to the campus community a few weeks ago, UPD has not done anything yet to raise awareness of the new app, mainly because of the cold weather. UPD plans on increasing its presence in the Academic Mall once the weather gets nicer to promote the new app.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After downloading the app, the user is asked to enter their school email address. After filling out some quick information, picking a username and password and confirming that email address, the Guardian app is ready to go. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Now that we put it in app form, students have accessibility to have all these features all in one app,” Casale said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SB Guardian lets students pick “guardians,” or trusted individuals, to add to the app. Students can message them and alerts can be sent to them in an emergency. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The Guardians feature is a great benefit of the app,” Casale said. “It depends on the person. It can be a roommate or anyone else you trust.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The app allows the user to set a safety timer. This lets the students share their status and location to select people, intended to be used when they are walking home alone or meeting with someone they do not know. Their Guardians will be notified if their timer expires.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to the Emergency Management website, if the user does not deactivate their timer when they arrive safely, University Police will be called.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If the timer is deactivated when the student arrives safely, the University Police Department will not receive a notification that a timer was ever set. Users can also add a voice message that will be sent to UPD if their
time elapses. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Emergency Management website also states that in the event that a user is forced to deactivate their timer, Guardian has a false deactivation code that will automatically send a panic alert to the police. The code is one, number higher than the students pin. It will appear to turn
off normally.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SB Guardian also lets users make emergency calls and send text tips. They can call 911 within the app itself or send text or picture message tips if they see something suspicious. SB Guardian also allows students to call University Police directly from the app with just a click of a button.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You can talk to each other and give reassurance to someone that you will look out for them when they go out,” Casale said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

In an effort to quell off-campus issues among students, landlords and the community, Stony Brook University’s Commuter Student Services officially took over the Off-Campus Living and Off-Campus Housing offices in February 2014, redefining the office and significantly expanding <span style="line-height: 1.5;">its demographic.</span>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The office tracks inquiries from students regarding off-campus housing, which have increased as the new structure now includes commuter graduate students in addition to undergraduates.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This raised the number of potential students sending in inquiries from approximately 6,500 to 15,000, according to Emily Resnick, assistant director of Commuter Student Services and Off-Campus Living.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We’ve seen our inquiry levels triple over, in this year alone up until this point…what we did last year for the entire year,” she said. “If numbers speak loudest, that’s one to shout from the rooftops.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The transition began unofficially in the summer of 2013 and came as a result of restructuring within the Faculty Student Association–which formerly managed off-campus housing listings–and talks with departments such as Community Relations, Campus Residences and Community Standards to determine how to educate students about their rights and responsibilities in off-campus living.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was also, in part, the result of ongoing off-campus living issues between the residential community, students and landlords who rent spaces without Town of Brookhaven permits and do not comply with town
housing codes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Commuter Student Services and Off-Campus Living deals directly with students and works closely with Community Relations, which connects with the residents, Resnick said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The Community Relations Office has been engaged in this issue for the past four years and has had a continual and productive dialogue with many stakeholders in the community to assure our students are able to find safe and affordable off campus housing,” Elaine Crosson, the university’s vice president for government and community relations, wrote in an email.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A major challenge the office saw in the transition in terms of off-campus housing is that there are a limited number of legal listings available because landlords are required to provide a Town permit, Resnick said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I feel strongly that that’s the right way to go,” she said of obtaining a permit. “However, with that said, there are many people who rent without a permit and do so therefore illegally.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While not having a permit does not mean that a dwelling is unsafe, it opens up the possibility of danger, Resnick said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Students go to the office with issues such as living in homes that are over capacity according to Town codes, sometimes having makeshift rooms.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For accessory apartments, landlords must live in the home and “In no event may there be more than one bedroom per accessory apartment,” the Town of Brookhaven accessory apartment code states.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The office held its second “Lease, Landlords and You” last November, a workshop for students to learn how to go about renting legally and avoid being misled by landlords.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There, some students voiced their concerns regarding their landlords.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I’m a medical student living off-campus and I’m having issues with my landlord who essentially is taking advantage of us little by little,” Sanida Lukovic, a first-year medical student, said after the workshop. “We have a huge security deposit down and I’m concerned that his behavior so far will sort of lead to him trying to keep the deposit when
we leave.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jhon Restrepo, a junior economics major who attended the workshop said his landlord would not allow him to take picture of the basement apartment he moved into.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Phil Solages, the Graduate Student Organization attorney, spoke at the event and said that it is illegal on Long Island to have habitable space in a basement.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“So the reason he didn’t want you to do that is you were living in an illegal dwelling,” Solages told Restrepo.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I do generally focus on scenarios in which the student’s being taken advantage of by a landlord or if they’re not in a safe environment or if they just have questions,” Resnick said. “It’s not always the scariest scenario.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The new off-campus living structure inherited issue that Stony Brook Concerned </span>Homeowners, Ltd., a nonprofit organization formed by residents near the university, Bruce Sander and Anthony DeRosa, <span style="line-height: 1.5;">wanted addressed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">This included their frustration with “unscrupulous landlords in their neighborhood illegally renting homes to unsuspecting Stony Brook University students,” according to the group’s website.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Sander met with university officials in February and was notified of the changes within the school.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">He said there is still a problem of university employees being the owners of homes that rent to eight to 10 students, while the legal town limit for non-related tenants in four.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">“They alerted us of all the changes that they’re making and we applaud them,” he said. “We also still reinforce the fact their own employees, their own professors, need to obey the laws and that is our biggest beef with it all.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">“The thing is it’s anyone’s right including a community member, a neighbor to report something to the town that appears to be illegal or unsafe, and then from there, a formal eviction process can take 60 to 90 days, and that’s ultimately at the hands of the landlord,” Resnick said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The State University of New York Board of Trustees approved the creation of a Doctor of Pharmacy degree at Stony Brook University on March 11, opening the path for Stony Brook to open a new School of Pharmacy and
Pharmaceutical Sciences.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The school will be the first school of pharmacy on Long Island. However, the Doctor of Pharmacy degree still needs the approval of the New York State Board of Regents.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The Pharm.D. program at Stony Brook Medicine will provide a unique training experience for aspiring leaders in pharmacy,” said Dr. Kenneth Kaushansky, the senior vice president of health sciences at Stony Brook, at the board’s Academic Affairs Committee on March 10.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kaushansky said that the school’s mission will be “to train high achieving students with diverse backgrounds, both in the basic science and practice of pharmacy, and by example and innovative coursework, stimulate our students to specialize, so as to operate at the ‘top of the license’ in rewarding careers in academic and hospital specialty pharmacy, population medication management and in the pharmaceutical sciences and industry.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The School<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of Pharmacy will join the other health science schools under the Stony Brook Medicine banner: the School of Medicine, the School of Dental Medicine, the School of Health Technology and Management, the School of Nursing and the School of Social Welfare.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stony Brook University Hospital, a 603-bed teaching hospital, will provide an academic clinical training site for the school. The hospital has 72 pharmacists, 15 of whom will serve as clinical faculty for the school.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“With the Stony Brook focus on population health and our Schools of Medicine, Health Technology and a program in public health, it is perfectly logical for us to focus on training pharmacists to play an important role in care management,” Kaushansky said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Edmund Hayes, the assistant director of the Stony Brook University Hospital Pharmacy and the director of the Pharmacy Residency Program, has been appointed the School of Pharmacy’s interim dean, according to a university press release.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The School of Pharmacy will be very selective, enrolling a class of only 75 students per year, Kaushansky said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Students will be able to pursue dual degrees, such as Pharm.D./MBA, Pharm.D./MPH, Pharm.D./M.D. and Pharm.D./Ph.D.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The School of Pharmacy will meet the educational requirements from Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education and state licensure requirements.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The school will also offer electives in basic drug development, drug delivery, oncology, diabetes management and more, Kaushansky said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Board of Trustees also approved a new Doctor of Pharmacy degree for Binghamton University at the March 11 meeting.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Trustee Ronald Ehrenberg, the chairman of the board’s Academic Affairs Committee, said the proposals for the new degrees “received positive recommendations for the [SUNY] provost office, noting that one, they met local needs; two, they align with the campus mission; and three, they were the result of careful and strategic planning.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Speeding tickets issued by UPD almost quadruple in one year</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_37486" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-37486 size-full-width" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RebeccaAnzel_Cars_Speedlimit-600x255.jpg" alt="REBECCA ANZEL / THE STATESMAN " width="600" height="255" /> The speed limit was lowered from 55 mph to 45 mph last year on Nicolls Road near the entrances to Stony Brook University's campus to ensure pedestrian safety. <em>REBECCA ANZEL / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Speeding tickets issued by University Police in 2014 increased by 290 percent compared to 2013, according to Chief of Police Robert J. Lenahan and the Office of the Vice President of Administration. The increase to 147 tickets coincided with last spring’s reduction of the speed limit from 55 mph to 45 mph along Nicolls Road between South Entrance and Route 25A.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The University Police Department was highly focused on speed enforcement last year,” Lenahan, who is also the assistant vice president of Campus Safety, said in an email on Monday, emphasizing that UPD maintains a wide range of focuses and will<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“remain committed to enforcing life, safety, [and] traffic violations.” He noted that University Police do not have ticket quotas or production goals—the former is illegal in New York State.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lenahan also confirmed the 290 percent increase between 2013 and 2014. The numbers had been initially reported as 150 tickets and a 297 percent increase in the minutes of a March 2 University Senate meeting. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stony Brook University announced the speed limit change on April 29, 2014 as the result of the combined effort of Stony Brook administration, UPD and Suffolk County officials, according to initial reports by <i>The Statesman</i>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Stony Brook University requested a review of the 55 MPH speed limit based on a history of vehicle accidents,” Lenahan wrote on Monday. In the email and in an interview with <i>The Statesman</i> last May, Lenahan cited the multiple fatalities that had occurred along Nicolls Road in recent years involving both pedestrians and motorists.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2011, Seong Hoon Baek, 21, a Stony Brook senior at the time, died after being hit by a truck while cycling on Nicolls Road, according to media reports. The year prior, Shubo Lin, 20, a transfer student from China Medical University enrolled in the Intensive English Program, died after being hit by multiple vehicles while attempting to cross Nicolls Road on foot.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On July 26 of last year, after the speed limit change, a motorcyclist died after losing control of his vehicle and colliding with a cable along the center median between the Main and South Entrances of campus. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I think we have made this roadway safer,” Lenahan said. In support of this claim, he cited the decreased speed limit and recent efforts by the University to educate motorists on the dangers of speeding, as well as the newly-purchased Variable Message Sign that was placed on Nicolls Road to remind drivers of their current speed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the subject of safe travel back and forth between West and East Campus, Lenahan “would stress the use of the University’s Transportation system [or] using the underpass to travel between” the two campuses. He discouraged pedestrians from trying to cross Nicolls Road itself.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The University has engaged in an aggressive traffic and pedestrian safety campaign,” Lenahan added.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The “Serious About Safety” campaign, created in April of 2012 as part of a safety initiative launched by Stony Brook President Samuel L. Stanley Jr. after the death of Baek, urges pedestrians to be attentive and wear reflective clothing while asking motorists to yield to pedestrians whenever possible. The campaign also encourages both parties to not use “personal electronic devices so that they can be more aware of their surroundings.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>Correction: March 27, 2015</strong></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em>A previous version of this story stated that the number of speeding tickets issued by UPD nearly tripled in one year. The number of tickets issued nearly quadrupled, and the online version of this story has been corrected. </em></p>]]></content:encoded>

What does curcumin, the main component of the Asian spice turmeric, have in common with periodontal disease? Quite a lot, according to one Stony Brook professor—and it does not just stop with gum disease.

<em>The Statesman</em> had a chance to speak with Dr. Lorne Golub, distinguished professor in the Department of Oral Biology and Pathology in the Stony Brook University School of Dental Medicine, about a new type of anti-inflammatory compound based on the chemical structure of curcumin.

The compound, known as TRB-N0224, was co-developed in collaboration with Francis Johnson, Ph.D., professor of chemistry and pharmacology at Stony Brook. It was recently announced as part of a new licensing agreement with Traverse Biosciences in an effort to develop more effective treatments for canine periodontal disease.

Golub is best known for helping discover the non-antibiotic properties of the tetracyclines early in his career at Stony Brook. The work of Golub and his colleagues led to a host of university-held patents, including ones for the highly successful drugs Periostat for periodontitis and Oracea for acne and skin inflammation.

“It all started decades ago while studying a rat model for diabetes, in which my colleagues and I noticed that collagenases, the enzymes responsible for breaking down collagen fibers, were vastly elevated compared to non-diabetic rats,” Golub said.

“By following the biochemistry we discovered that tetracycline, a common antibiotic, had this unexpected, previously unrecognized ability to inhibit a family of enzymes known as matrix metalloproteases (MMPs),” Golub said.

MMPs are a class of enzymes capable of degrading, a slew of proteins in the extracellular matrix that surrounds cells. MMPs are now thought to play an important role in all kinds of inflammatory diseases.

“Originally we were studying the mediators of the inflammatory response and the enzymes that are produced by the patient’s own body, the host,” Golub said. “Periodontitis just happened to be the most common chronic inflammatory disease."

Golub added, “It turns out, as we have recognized over the past several decades, that in the case of periodontal disease it is not the bacterial products that cause tissue breakdown in our gums so much as it is our own body.”

This same mechanism that involves local inflammation triggering a systemic response has been implicated in everything from rheumatoid arthritis to angiogenesis in cancer. It is also thought to underlie the increased risk of heart disease and stroke that patients with periodontitis face.

“The first MMP inhibitor drug we developed was Periostat. It was designed to produce blood levels so low of doxycycline, another type of tetracycline, that it could not function as an antibiotic, and therefore would not have major side effects and the emergence of antibiotic-resistance bacteria,” Golub said.

“Later, one of the things discovered was that the active site in all these tetracycline antibiotics had a structure known as the beta-diketone moiety,” Golub said. “We proceeded to make new chemicals that preserved this metal ion binding site but eliminated the amino group responsible for antibiotic activity.”

Golub added, “Now we were able to use much higher levels of these compounds without getting the antibiotic properties.”

More recently Golub turned to Johnson to try to develop better MMP inhibitors to treat periodontitis.

“We thought, let’s make a spin-off of the four-ring tetracycline and instead use the two-ring structure of curcumin,” Golub said. “And so, just like the modified tetracycline compounds we made a chemically-modified form of curcumin.”

As part of their latest efforts, Golub and Johnson hope TRB-N0224 can help fast-track FDA approval for the use of chemically-modified curcumins in the treatment of periodontitis in dogs and, eventually, humans as well.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Sexwolf: I really like porn</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Everyone is curious about sex; which probably contributes to why I write a weekly article about sex. We’re all wondering about sex. We’re so curious that there’s an entire museum dedicated to sex in New York City (It’s called the Museum of Sex on 5th Avenue, I highly recommend it).

It’s this morbid curiosity that has made the pornography industry so huge and still growing. (For those who missed it, that was a penis reference.) Pornography has permitted many a 7th grader to understand exactly how sex works. I don’t know about the rest you, but health class in 6th grade did not teach me that the penis actually goes in the vagina. I used to think two people just went under the covers and squirmed around like they do in Sims. But thanks to pornhub.com, I learned what sex actually entails.

I am of the belief that porn is awesome, and I say that at the risk of being attacked by liberal feminists arguing how it increases sexual violence and discrimination against women.

I believe that if it gets me off, can it really be that bad? Unfortunately the answer is yes. Porn, like alcohol, chocolate fudge layer cake, and all pleasing things in life can become addicting. The Statesman was contacted by a gentleman named Reed Davis who asked the newspaper to help bring to light the issue of pornography addiction, something that can be as detrimental to someone’s life as any other addiction. An addiction is anything that interrupts or is damaging to your life. I have created a list of some behaviors that might suggest you are suffering from a pornography addiction.

Watching porn together can be a fun way to spice up a dulling sex life. But if you can’t play without pressing play, this could be indicative of an addiction, and your partner is probably really offended.

If you shift your partner mid-position to get a better view of the Jugs video that plays in the background every time you have sex, you might have a problem. To see this move in action, please refer to Season 2 Episode 6 of "Sex and the City": "The Cheating Curve."

If you have ever, even if only once, told your friend that you were staying home to hang out with “the girls” (gone wild), I encourage you from the bottom of my heart to seek help.

A pornography addiction sounds almost comical. I mean thirsty people still want to make it rain one way or another even if there’s no clouds in sight, so is it really so wrong turn on the garden house yourself? Even if it’s once or twice a day? To be perfectly honest, I watch porn every time my roommate is out and I’m not in class, which happens to work out to Thursday from 230-5 but I would do it every day if I could.

So does that count as pornography addiction? Maybe. Although I’m a little biased for this particular situation, I venture my opinion and say it isn’t because it doesn’t interfere with my non-existent sex life. But if your porn-watching habits start to create any kind of issues outside of your computer monitor, think about treatment. I promise you it’s really embarrassing being the person on the other side of the porn addiction. It makes you really question your own addiction to that chocolate fudge layer cake.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The kNOw: I demand another spring break</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ah, spring break.

The highlight of the semester; a week filled with endless days, maybe a trip to warm places with my closest friends, alcohol if you are so inclined, and the absence of classes. A week for me to kick back and sit on my couch and allow myself to watch all the television I want.

I did not take a trip anywhere, but I definitely sat on my couch. I sat on my couch and watched a dozen Snapchats of my friends having a banging spring break. Wearing sweatpants with unwashed hair, while eating a loaf of bread, I tried really hard to imagine what it would be like to a) be in the best shape of my life, b) be sitting on the beach, feeling the warmth of the sun after this brutal winter and c) actually relax.

Because instead of spending my break in a mind-numbingly calm state, I stress-ate copious slices of toast as I thought about the lab report and two exams due this week.

And I am definitely not alone.

It is well-understood that a majority of Stony Brook students spend their spring breaks studying and stressing just as much as they do while school is in session. Why? Because students in CHE 132 are gearing up for their second midterm Monday night, the first day after spring break. Students in BIO 362 have an exam on Thursday, March 26. I have an unfortunate friend who has a midterm every week until finals.

And it is not just these big classes that schedule exams for immediately after returning from break. There are even professors who have specially assigned homework for spring break. My roommate is in an art class this semester and she was expected, by her professor, to show up every day during spring break and work on the assignment. Is it wrong of me to think that all of this is a little ridiculous?

A “break” is literally defined as “a pause in work.” The only thing I “paused” from this week was being physically present in my classes. The daily stress that I face while I am in school was still lingering around me like a dark cloud while I cuddled with my mom and watched Grey’s. I could not even properly binge-watch Netflix because I still felt guilty over choosing “The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” over my lab report (which is still not done, by the way).
This is spring break. I am not mad that I didn't go anywhere. I'm mad that I couldn't sit at home and do nothing with peace-of-mind. I'm mad because I have one week off to pull myself together from whatever disaster this semester has inadvertently become, cry out my feelings, experience a moment of happiness and then settle back into the routine of school.

But I did not get my week because that dark cloud never left that spot in the back of my mind. It followed me every time I got Chipotle with a friend, played video games with my brother and ate dinner with my parents. I knew that come Monday, I had exams and lab reports and everything else in the world to take care of. I spent the week I was supposed to unwind reeling myself back up to face the challenge of the rest of the semester.

Am I complaining? Maybe. I could have done my work before the break started. I could have spent half of it being responsible so the other half would have been a great time. But it does not detract from the point that there is still an inherent stress. At a university that is already filled with over-worked students packing their schedules mile-high with intense upper-division credits, these breaks are crucial to our overall well-being. We're not MIT here, with once-a- month mandated three-day weekends. This break is all we have for the spring semester until finals are over.
Breaks are important. We are not a laid-back student body. We are a student body that challenges ourselves academically, does research and works to pay loans. We are a student body that pushes ourselves to go beyond academics to run clubs, host meetings and organize campus-wide events. We are a resilient student body, but we need breaks for our own mental health. Being over-stressed, overwhelmed, sleep-deprived, and tired is not how we are going to get through this semester. It is NOT the road map to success on any level.

What I am asking here is for professors to lay back. These midterms are planned so far in advance that scheduling them for the week after spring break is a low blow. Assign homework and projects to be due a little longer after returning from break, not the week after. Let us have our fun and maybe we would not look so miserable in your classes on Monday. Give us the time to really know what it feels like to not worry about our next midterm, oral presentation, or essay. Give us the time to relax.

Give us a real spring break.]]></content:encoded>

On Saturday afternoon, the Seawolves looked to continue their six-game undefeated streak on the road against America East rival New Hampshire. SBU won handedly, as a dominant second half performance led the team to a 13-4 win.

The first half started with a Wildcat's goal by senior midfielder Laura Puccia, off the assist from senior attacking Kayleigh Hinkle. Senior midfielder Michelle Rubino hit the equalizer for Stony Brook just seconds after Puccia's goal.

Sophomore attacker Courtney Murphy scored a second goal for the Seawolves, putting them up 2-1. But Puccia tied it up with a free position shot.

The back-and-forth game was ended by the Seawolves, who went on a two goal run. Murphy got her second goal for the day off of an assist by junior attacker Taylor Ranftle. Ranftle then assisted senior midfielder Amber Kupres, giving the Seawolves a 4-2 lead.

Even though they were down two, the Wildcats were not about to throw in the towel. Sophomore Marissa Gurello scored her third goal of the season, bringing the Wildcats within one of Stony Brook. However, Kupres hit her second goal of the game to close the half with the Seawolves leading 5-3.

The second started off with the only New Hampshire goal of the half. Senior attacker Becca Graves scored her eighth goal of the season off an assist from senior midfielder Rachael Nock. With the Wildcats within one, the Seawolves had to turn on the afterburners. Murphy sparked the Seawolves eight goal run, scoring her third goal of the game.

Sophomore Dorrien Van Dyke scored her eighth goal of the season soon after. Kupres got a hat trick off of another assist by Ranftle. Freshman attacker Kylie Ohlmiller got on the board with a her fourteenth goal of the season. The barrage of scoring continued, as Van Dyke scored her second goal of the game off an assist by Murphy.

Even with three minutes left, the Seawolves showed no signs of slowing down. Sophomore midfielder Kristin Yevoli scored an unassisted goal, making it 11-4 for the Seawolves. Freshman midfielder Samantha DiSalvo scored her third goal of the season off an assist by junior Natalie Marciniak. Marciniak scored the final goal of the game, closing the blowout at 13-4. Fueling the blowout was the massive amount of turnovers by New Hampshire. While the Seawolves had four total for the game, the Wildcats had six in the first half alone.

Next up for the undefeated Seawolves is a four game homestretch, which begins this Tuesday against Rutgers.]]></content:encoded>

Christa Scognamiglio broke onto the Stony Brook women’s basketball scene as the calendar flipped to 2015, but she was not able to save the Seawolves’ season last Thursday night in Loudonville, New York.

The sophomore tallied 16 points and nine rebounds, but it was not enough as Stony Brook had its season come to an end against Siena 53-46 in the first round of the Women’s Basketball Invitational at the Times Union Center.

Fellow sophomore Kori Bayne-Walker finished the day with 12 points and six boards, and senior Jessica Ogunnorin finished with nine points and eight rebounds in her final game in a Seawolves uniform.

The game stayed neck and neck until late in the second half, when the Saints used a 9-0 run to extend a one-point advantage into a double-digit one, 49-39, with 4:06 to go. The Seawolves were able to cut the lead to seven, and when it looked like the team was gaining some momentum, Tehresa Coles rebounded her own miss and put it back home with just over two minutes to play and making it a nine-point Saints advantage. Neither team was able to shoot the ball well from the field, with Siena shooting 34.4 percent from the field and Stony Brook shooting at a 31.4 percent clip. Caroline McCombs’ squad accepted an invitation to participate in the WBI, after being upset by the sixth-seed UMBC Retrievers in Quarterfinals of the America East Tournament. The Seawolves finished the season 17-14, losing their final three matchups. Siena moved onto the second round of the WBI to take on Xavier. Stony Brook fell in its second-straight postseason game, falling to Michigan in last years’ Women’s National Invitational Tournament.]]></content:encoded>

A strong final 30 minutes helped the Stony Brook men’s lacrosse team earn it first conference win of the season on Saturday afternoon, as the Seawolves defeated UMBC 12-6.

Junior Brody Eastwood led the way for the Seawolves, finding the back of the net four times during the game, including three times in the second half alone. Senior Mike Rooney also played a big part in the victory, scoring a goal and dishing out six assists.

Stony Brook struggled to find its offense early on in the game. The Seawolves trailed 1-0 with 4:35 remaining in the first period, finally evening the score when junior Challen Rogers finally got SBU on the board. Rogers tied things up with his ninth goal of the season, with junior Chris Hughes getting the helper.

After the goal, Stony Brook still struggled to find its game, as goals from Nate Lewnes and Jack Gannon put UMBC ahead, 3-1. With 13:29 remaining before halftime, the Seawolves would pull closer on the scoreboard thanks to a goal from an unexpected source of offense.

Junior midfielder Frank Lucatuorto, who is more known for his strong faceoff abilities and defensive skills, found the back of the net to pull SBU within one. It was the first goal of the season for Lucatuorto, who had only scored once in his previous 30 contests.

A little over two minutes later, Eastwood scored his first goal of the game to tie things up at three. The contest would remain even going into halftime.

Eastwood opened the scoring in the third, striking wih 9:29 left in the period to give Stony Brook its first lead of the game. Rooney would extend the Seawolves lead to two shortly after, scoring his 20th of the season with 7:42 remaining in the third.

SBU’s lead, however, would be short-lived. Lewnes scored his second goal of the game with 6:55 left in the period. Eight seconds later, Conor Finch tied the game at five.

With time winding down in the third, Eastwood would once again come up big for his team. The junior scored with five seconds left on the clock to give his team a lead heading into the final period.

In the fourth, Stony Brook would take control of the game, scoring the first three goals of the period to take a 9-5 lead.

Sophomore Alex Corpolongo put the Seawolves ahead by two goals, 7-5, when he scored his first of the game and 12th of the season with 8:31 left in regulation time. Then, with 6:41 left, Rogers would score his second of the game, followed by Eastwood’s fourth of the game a little over a minute later.

Lewnes completed his hat trick with 3:27 left on the clock to pull the Retrievers within three. But, the Seawolves would respond with three goals before time expired to put the game officially out of reach.

Sophomore Jeff Reh notched his second of the year to make it a 10-6 contest. Then, Lucatuorto struck again to make it 11-6, giving him the first multi-goal game of his career. Junior Matt Schultz capped off the game’s scoring with his 13th goal of the season. Freshman goalkeeper Brandon Maciejewski made seven saves for Stony Brook on Saturday, and picked up his second win of the season.

The Seawolves were dominant on the draw against UMBC, winning 17-of-22 face-offs in the game. Lucatuorto was 13-of-16 on draws, while sophomore Jay Lindsay won 4-of-6. Stony Brook also had a large advantage in ground
balls in the matchup. SBU had 28 ground balls compared to the Retrievers 18.

The Seawolves now get another week of rest before their next game. After the win SBU is 6-2 overall this season and 1-1 in America East-play. The team does not play again until Saturday, when the Seawolves head to Burlington to take on Vermont.

After that, Stony Brook will be back home for a pair of out-of-conference matchups. They will host out-of-conference foe Quinnipiac on March 31. Then, on April 4, Princeton will make its way to LaValle Stadium to take on the Seawolves.]]></content:encoded>

In a season that has already been horrendously stunted by inclement weather, the Stony Brook Seawolves baseball team’s spell of bad luck spilled over onto Sunday afternoon when they fell to the Creighton Blue Jays by a final of 8-3. Originally planned as three-game, three-day series against the club from Omaha, Nebraska, the “series” became a simple one-game confrontation on Sunday afternoon with nearly no traces of snow in sight. Sending their ace to the hill in junior Tyler Honahan, the Seawolves seemed to have the upper-hand on paper.

But for the first time on the year, Honahan would struggle mightily. Allowing five earned runs in just 1.1 innings of work, Stony Brook faced a 7-0 deficit after just an inning and a half of action. It was an error by Honahan himself in the second inning that spurned on a fire that could seemingly not be contained.

By the time junior Chad Lee extinguished the flames, six runs had crossed the plate, presenting a daunting task for the Seawolves’ offense. If the entire lineup could have hit like junior outfielder Jack Parenty, a comeback may have been feasible. After an RBI double in both the fifth and seventh innings, Parenty would finish the day a perfect 3-for-3 with two of the three Stony Brook RBIs. The Jays employed their entire arsenal of arms, with no pitcher seeing the hill for more than two innings.

Eight pitchers would combine to hold the Seawolves to just seven hits and three runs. This was not nearly enough to scale back into the hole they had presented for themselves. Manager Matt Senk’s decision to mix up the batting order and place senior catcher Cole Peragine in the leadoff spot has seemingly begun to pay off, as Peragine walked three times in the Sunday contest.

He has now earned 17 free passes on the season, and would score on both of Parenty’s RBI doubles. Next up, the Seawolves hit the road to take on the Sacred Heart Pioneers on Wednesday afternoon at 3:30. They will then return home next week for a planned three-game series against a new America East opponent, the UMass-Lowell
River Hawks. It is the school’s second season in the conference, but the Seawolves will look to avenge a series loss last season, as Stony Brook dropped two of three in Lowell.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Softball searching for more consistency from offense</title>

She has had a 3-0 start this season. <em>BASIL JOHN / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

After coming into the year with championship aspirations, Stony Brook softball has posted mixed results through the first 15 games of the season. The Seawolves currently sit at 7-8 on the year. Although the team has yet to play a home game or begin its conference schedule, the early results from the team appear on the surface to be disappointing.

One reason for this sub-.500 performance is the limited offensive production. The Seawolves have recorded the fewest hits of all America East teams this season.

Regular starters Kellie Reynolds, Melissa Phelan, Chelsea Evans, Kim Ragazzo and Lexie Shue are all currently batting below .200. These five players have combined for just 12 extra base hits. Another issue stems from a lack of depth at the back end of the rotation.

Although reigning conference Pitcher of the Year Allison Cukrov has impressed with a 3-0 record, freshman pitcher Maddy Neales has gone just 1-2 with a 6.75 ERA in five appearances. Likewise, junior Jane Sallen is only 3-6 in her nine starts this season.

Despite these mishaps, there are many positive takeaways to be had through the season’s first 15 games. Senior outfielder Bria Green is dominating with the bat, leading the conference in hitting, home runs and slugging percentage.

Green’s .429 batting average makes her one of just three America East players with a batting average over .400.

Although a 7-8 record may appear to be disappointing, the Seawolves have actually gotten off to a better start this year than they did last year.

At this point last season, the Seawolves had a 5-10 record through 15 games. The 2014 team was able to turn their season around by dominating conference play with a 15-2 record. Eventually, that team made its way to the America East Championship.

The Seawolves may not have had an ideal start to the season, but it appears as if there is room for improvement. With stars like Green and Cukrov, Stony Brook still factors in as a contender during conference play. Stony Brook saw its series with UMass-Lowell postponed over the weekend.

The team will return to action this Tuesday, when the Seawolves host a doubleheader against Central Connecticut.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Winter weather proves to be problematic for SBU club teams</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_37756" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-37756" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/DSC_0077-600x399.jpg" alt="SAHER JAFRI / THE STATESMAN" width="600" height="399" /> The men's rugby team, above, which plays on the Stony Brook fields, had practices at an indoor facility in Ronkonkoma during the winter. The snow this semester caused "a turbulent couple of weeks," according to Thomas Kirnbauer, advisor for the men's rugby team. SAHER JAFRI / THE STATESMAN[/caption]

The snow and ice that covered Stony Brook University’s Campus Recreation Field Complex by the South P Lot this winter was more than an inconvenience to sports clubs that needed to maintain their practice and game schedules.

Jay Souza, the director of the Department of Campus Recreation, said that plowing the complex’s artificial turf field requires a third-party contractor. The complex’s two grass fields, Souza said, cannot be plowed or shoveled without being destroyed, so teams had to wait for the snow to clear on its own.

“We have to make sure that fields are safe and playable,” Souza said. “If they’re just a sheet of ice, then we’d have to cancel operations.”

The Stony Brook University campus was hit by several snow storms since the start of the semester. Winter Storm Juno dumped about 20 inches of snow on Jan. 26, and Winter Storm Linus dropped about six inches of snow on Feb. 2, according to the National Weather Service.

The Department of Campus Recreation and the sports clubs paid for the turf field to be plowed on the last week of February at a rate of about $100 per hour, Souza said, but Winter Storm Thor packed on another seven inches of snow on March 5.

“It’s terrible, but it’s something that can’t be controlled,” said James Alrassi, a member of the men’s rugby team and the executive vice president of the Undergraduate Student Government, in an interview. “We’ve only had, like, one practice in two weeks.”

The men’s rugby team, which plays in the Empire Rugby Conference, had a 10-team tournament on Stony Brook’s field scheduled for March 7, so the turf field had be plowed yet again on March 6.

Thomas Kirnbauer, the advisor for the men’s rugby team and the administrative director of USG, said the snow caused “a turbulent couple of weeks” for his team. He commended Campus Recreation for paying for the second plowing rather than asking the sports clubs for additional funds.

“It allowed us to have a tournament that wouldn’t have been possible at any other school in the Northeast,” he said.

Kirnbauer mentioned that the men’s rugby team also used an indoor facility in Ronkonkoma during the winter to prepare for a national tournament in Las Vegas in February.

“It’s not nearly as good as a full outdoor field, but it at least allowed us to exercise and have some ball in hand and do what we could,” he said.

Susan DiMonda, the advisor for the women’s lacrosse team and the associate dean and director of Student Life, said that Campus Recreation had to wait for the right time to get the field plowed.

“I think the staff and Recreation did their best to make the fields accessible,” she said. “Plowing is costly, and they have to do it at the right time. If they plow and it snows one or two days later, it’s like, ‘Well, there’s $2,000 out the window.’”

At the USG senate meeting on Feb. 26, representatives of the men’s club lacrosse team said they had originally planned to shovel the fields with the women’s club lacrosse team and the rugby team.

“Fair enough with the shovelling, it wasn’t approved,” said Jonathan Sadeh, the president of the men’s club lacrosse team. “We have to get it plowed, and we now have to pay for it. Don’t worry; we didn’t do anything illegal.”

DiMonda called spring “a tricky season” but said that the improving weather means the fields will be more playable soon.

“Now we just have to wait for the fields to dry out so they won’t be so soft,” she said.

The university officially opened the newly-renovated field complex in April 2014. The complex’s three fields—the two grass fields and one turf field—measure over nine acres, according to a university press release.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When one thinks of the greatest runners in Stony Brook Track and Field History, there is one name that comes to mind: Lucy Van Dalen. The 2012 graduate won the NCAA indoor mile championship and competed in London during that year’s Olympic games.

Second on the list? Well, if it is not already Christina Melian, she is making a strong argument for that spot. After her appearance in the 2014 NCAA Outdoor Championships in the 5,000 meters, the now-junior made her first appearance at the Indoor Championships, this time held at the University of Arkansas, in the same event.

She is the sixth different student-athlete to qualify for a Track and Field National Championship as an individual in either indoor or outdoor since 2008. The Staten Island-native placed No. 13 down in Fayetteville, running a time of 16:17.26. This placed her in second-team All America honors, but was not necessarily her best effort. At the John Terrier Classic, she ran a personal record of 16:00.14 on Jan. 30. If she would have repeated that, she would have climbed into the Top 10 on the leaderboard. She did beat her national ranking, entering the meet No. 15 in the country. But, the junior will be looking to improve during this spring season, and make it back to the Outdoor Championships, which this season are being held in Eugene, Oregon.

Jane Clark is a newcomer looking to follow in the Van Dalen/Melian legacy. She got off to a good start during this indoor season, claiming an America East title in the 1,000 meters. This is the second straight season a Seawolf claimed the title in that race, as then-senior Olivia Burne crossed the finish line first last time around. Clark finished her season eighth in the ECAC Championships, clocking in at 2:57.87.]]></content:encoded>

HEATHER KHALIFA / THE STATESMAN" width="600" height="400" /></a> Jameel Warney, above, has been a two-time America East Player of the Year. One of the deficiencies that the Seawolves need to improve is getting Warney the ball. <em>HEATHER KHALIFA / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

Stony Brook has one of the nation’s most dominant basketball players on its team in Jameel Warney. Alongside him is a versatile junior in Rayshaun McGrew, an electric, though inconsistent scorer in Carson Puriefoy and commonly two knockdown shooters. Why is it, then, that the Seawolves managed to finish with just the 224th-most efficient offense in the country and their worst in four years this year? It is easy to attribute SBU missing out on the NCAA Tournament to one play in particular, but outside of inexperience, it was scoring the basketball that most often hurt Stony Brook this year. While games with a ton of turnovers will dissipate as this young roster matures, there were a few underlying issues that plagued the offense throughout and will not go away on their own. One of these is Puriefoy’s unpredictable play. One night he scores 20 points on multiple threes and is the perfect counterpart to Warney. Then, he shoots 6-of-42 from the field in a four-game stretch. To his credit, Puriefoy came on strong in the postseason, especially in getting to the free throw line and hitting threes. But for the Seawolves offense to be formidable on a nightly basis, Puriefoy has to be formidable on a nightly basis. Oftentimes, the Seawolves will forget the simplest rule to their offensive success: give the ball to Warney. Only good can come out of getting the two-time America East Player of the Year the ball, yet he will go consecutive possessions without getting a touch. He constantly demands a double team and can pass out of it with the best of them, but can go ignored for costly minutes at a time. This is inexcusable for a team with this talent. These, among other problems, held back a Stony Brook offense with enough options and talent to be much better than it was this season. The Seawolves need to improve on these deficiencies heading into next year.

<em><strong>Point #2: Earning the America East’s third seed with a new head coach is not a step back for SBU women’s basketball.</strong> </em>

People may say that Head Coach Caroline McCombs had a lot of expectations hanging over her head when she took over the Seawolves bench over the summer. Stony Brook went from winning four games when Beth O’Boyle took the reins, to 14 then to 24. It went from a cellar dweller to title contended in one of the biggest turnarounds throughout the country. So, what would the former Auburn and Pittsburgh assistant McCombs be able to do to take a team with their best player, Sabre Proctor, still around and ready to make another run? The team managed 17 wins. In hindsight, that is a disappointment in comparison to what could have been for this year’s Seawolves. However, at the end of the season, McCombs and company put themselves in a position to do some damage in the America East Tournament. With Albany’s year-in year-out domination of the league along with Maine’s fantastic year, finishing even ahead of the Great Danes, it was unlikely that the Seawolves really could have done much better than they did. The only point to make is that Stony Brook was shocked in the America East quarterfinals by a team that they had brushed aside easily twice in conference play. The answer to that is simple: every team has a bad day, Stony Brook just had it in the wrong place at the wrong time.

<em><strong>Point #3: Next year could be the best season in program history for men’s team.</strong></em>

This season, Head Coach Steve Pikiell would almost routinely bring up the fact that the Seawolves had no seniors and relied heavily on five freshmen this season. Despite this, Stony Brook not only fell two points shy of an NCAA Tournament berth, but also finished with 23 wins on the season. With that in mind, there is plenty of reason to believe next year will be the program’s best. The entire team will be returning with the addition of point guard Lucas Woodhouse, a gifted shooter and distributor. Additionally, many of the uber-talented neophytes that proved huge for Stony Brook this past season will now have had a year under their belts in the college game and are likely to return much improved. Names like Roland Nyama, Bryan Sekunda and Deshaun Thrower will get to reach closer to their max potentials. While the Seawolves get to enjoy not having to spend the early part of their schedule building team chemistry, their conference foes are getting weaker. Albany’s all-conference first team member Sam Rowley is graduating along with Vermont’s Hector Harold. Even with the massive disappointment this season ended with, Stony Brook ended up impressing as a whole despite its lack of seasoned players. This has set the stage for what should be the best year in program history in 2016. Let’s see if they can make it happen.

<em><strong>Point #4: Sabre Proctor will be missed next season.</strong></em>

It is rare to find a student-athlete who can excel in every aspect of their sport. Stony Brook was lucky enough to find one of those talents in Proctor, a two-time All-America East First Team selection. There was not much she could not do. Proctor was a daunting presence for opposing defenses in the paint, with a combination of strength and athleticism that made her a nightmare for everybody to deal with. Yet, she could still step out and hit a jumper, as she showed many times throughout the year. With time ticking down in the shot clock, Proctor had no problem crossing over her defender and rising up for a shot. There is simply nobody on this team that could replicate her production. Next year, finding a way to cope without her will be both a problem and a key.]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“When we formed the band, none of us knew how to play instruments.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SWIM, a local Stony Brook band whose Facebook page describes them as “precise, dramatic and dynamic rock music,” did not get a start like any other college band. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“In January 2010, we were all in ninth grade, we formed a band,” lead singer Daniel McCaffrey, a sophomore nursing major at Stony Brook, said. “We wrote up a contract and everything, it was very official, saying that we were gonna be band mates. I think we spent the first five months learning how to play one Coldplay song.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many college bands form from a passion of turning their musical talents into something more, but SWIM’s start was sparked from the simple mind set of most high school teenagers—“Why not?” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The genesis of the band was not ability but friendship,” guitar player and pianist Justin Iaquinta, a sophomore business major at Stony Brook, said. “There are many bands that have people that can all play, but it was mostly about communication between us as band members.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SWIM is comprised of five band members: McCaffrey, the lead singer; Nick Riviezzo, who plays guitar and synth; Iaquinta, who plays guitar and piano; Tyler Aigotti,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>who plays bass; and Brian D’Angio who plays drums. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">McCaffrey, Riviezzo and Iaquinta all attend Stony Brook University, while Aigotti and D’Angio are juniors at Ward Melville High School. Though the band has lost and gained different members along the way, the dynamic of the band still remains the same: to have fun while making great music. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I feel like every group of friends at some point is like ‘Hey, let’s start a band’ but not many get the chance to actually do it,” Riviezzo, a sophomore computer engineering major, said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On Mondays and Saturdays, the five guys meet up in Iaquinta’s basement or garage to play. Practices usually run for about three hours and could vary from learning covers for a show to going through creative sessions and practicing some original music. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes, the band even has sleepover practices, a combination of playing music and hanging out until 2 or 3 a.m. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This has not happened in a while, as over the years each band practice has gotten more scheduled and serious. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Our practices are becoming very refined,” Riviezzo said. “We’re getting to the point where we know what we want to work on and it all just comes down to knowing our parts.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Naturally, getting sidetracked is hard to avoid. McCaffrey said the group is often sidetracked by talking about school or work during practices. McCaffrey, Riviezzo and Iaquinta all have jobs on top of work, school and playing in the band. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You have to set yourself sometime to study and then any other waking moment you have you dedicate to a show or getting to a practice or coming up with new material,” McCaffrey said. “It’s a little demanding.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And while SWIM does struggle with the internal debate of pursuing an education versus being full-time musicians, each band member has tried to balance between the two work. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Iaquinta transferred from Geneseo after his freshman year to attend Stony Brook and be in the band full time. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Both Aigotti and D’Angio are factoring SWIM into their college decision-making. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Iaquinta, however, says he does not like to separate his college education from his dedication to the band. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I’m a business major, so everything I learn in business I can apply to the music industry in some way,” Iaquinta said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SWIM’s first demo, “Natural Feeling,” was released on bandcamp this past December. Only three of SWIM’s songs are currently recorded because of the difficulty behind getting a good recording. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Natural Feeling” was recorded by D’Angios father in his basement and while the band said the recording was pretty muddy and low quality, they wanted to get something online in hopes of it bringing in more gigs. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">McCaffrey said the band has a dozen songs completed but not recorded, and the boys have a bunch of ideas in mind for future songs. </span></p>
<p class="p1">The band members hope they will be able to record more songs and be able to release a five-song EP by the end of the summer. But even after releasing the anticipated EP, SWIM has no intentions of stopping there.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We want to be as big as we can,” McCaffrey said. “I don’t think it’s that crazy to say we want to be the biggest band in the world. A professional but personable group that is good to its fan and is charitable. We want to spread the wealth and be activists not just musicians.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SWIM already has performances lined up for the next couple of months. The group will be preforming on March 27, at The Basement in Port Jeff and in Tabler Quad on March 28 of this year. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SWIM will also be performing at Earthstock and will be holding a few shows at The Bench in the upcoming weeks. Any updates about shows can be found on the group’s Facebook page. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SWIM is aware of the struggles it will face on the path to fame, but the band is optimistic and ready for the challenge. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I’m either going to die or make it. One way or another,” Iaquinta said. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

Having captured the youth vote for the past two elections, President Barack Obama is continuing to appeal to the college age demographic through his collaboration with Buzzfeed. The video, “Things Everybody Does But Doesn’t Talk About, Featuring President Obama,” depicts us in the juvenile state we regress into when no one is around, giving us the opportunity for self-liberation from the social norms.

It was an exceptional privilege to watch our president share his own activities during his leisure time. In addition, it is an honor for me to analyze this video that features one of the most eminent figures of our time.

In the first clip, we see Obama’s broad smile in front of a posh mirror. His smile exemplifies hope for salutary change in domestic and foreign policies. Pay close attention to the mirror and you would probably question why it is grimy. There is one rational reason for this setup. It symbolizes our President’s diligence and indefatigable efforts being made for this nation. The second clip of him posing with his fist on his chin further gives the notion of the progress that has been made throughout his time in office.

As we get to the third clip, we can say that our leader has a great sense of humor and is quite flirty. I mean, who would want a lame and monotonic president? In clip four, Obama does “the wink and the tongue.” One might say he is making himself look foolish. On the other hand, being modern or staying current with trends is very crucial. This quality allures the youth. In addition to exhibiting majestic body language, we can also agree he has a sumptuous fashion taste, especially in the shades depicted in the fifth clip.

Obama clearly shows he is not an egocentric man through the clips in which he takes “selfies.” The selfie stick’s purpose is not only to get the person trying to take a selfie, but the environment around them as well. The greediness for one’s self image is what Obama is trying to denounce in this clip.

Furthermore, we observe the passionate dedication he has for the policies that will benefit the average American. In order to announce his plans, he practices his speech and tries to make it as clear as possible so every syllable of the month “February” is pronounced perfectly. It is a shame to see how many people actually condemn our President for the most absurd incidents. Even tripping and spilling coffee or not being able to dip a large oatmeal cookie into a glass of milk is now being blamed on Obama. Really? “Thanks Obama.”

Anyway, we witness the next clips that reveal Obama’s hobbies. During his spare time, Obama indulges in sketching his wife, Michelle, holding a basket of fruit grown in the backyard of the White House. This not only shows love for his wife, but his ability to hold his own work at a high standard. In addition, his fervor for basketball is depicted in the next scene. The quintessentially parabolic motion set by his left arm with the follow through accentuates how great of a basketball player he really is.

At the end of the day, Americans have to consider if Obama really deserves to be abhorred. The aforementioned rationalization should be sufficient enough to conclude that the two terms of Obama’s presidency were successful. So do not forget, “The deadline for signing up for health insurance is Febrooouary… Fevruery 15th. In many cases you can get health insurance for less than a $100 a month. Just go to healthcare.gov to figure out how to sign up.”]]></content:encoded>

Last week, the Stony Brook women’s lacrosse team heated up in Florida to take down the No. 6 Gators before heading to the snowy setting of their America East opener at New Hampshire, where the Seawolves maintained their perfect record for the season.

Yet, instead of bringing the cold back to Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium where the Seawolves may have fallen off a bit against a Rutgers team that had nothing to lose, Stony Brook fired off one of their best all-around performances in a 16-4 win.

“One of the things I keep telling them is ‘block the noise’,” Head Coach Joe Spallina said after the comprehensive victory. “I don’t want to hear about us being in the top ten. That doesn’t really mean anything. The only number that matters is where you are at the end of the season. Our goal is to just keep playing great lacrosse.”

At the moment at least, the No. 12/8 Seawolves are doing just that, showing a complete effort all around the field, from an offense that has developed into a more cohesively dynamic threat as the season has come along, while the defense has been the dominant force that it has always been on Long Island.

Perhaps the most telling statistic of all was that Rutgers, a team that averages 8.6 goals per game, only managed eight shots against the always-stingy Stony Brook defense. Letdowns come from teams letting their guards down, but the Seawolves did anything but relax.

“We have to respect our opponents and I think that comes from the mindset of us, as coaches,” Spallina said, adding that if anything, beating a great team like the Gators only makes the squad work harder. “The practice after the Florida game was our toughest practice of the year just because we won’t allow them to look forward.”

Sophomore attacker Courtney Murphy looked straight at Rutgers and scored more goals than the entire team combined, netting six while dishing one off to classmate Dorrien Van Dyke in the win.

Murphy, who led freshmen from across the country last season in goals scored, has set a torrid pace once again, adding to her 27-goal total for the year. That is made even more impressive by the depth of the Seawolves offense, with the already-dangerous Van Dyke, senior Michelle Rubino, along with newcomers Kylie Ohlmiller and Taylor Ranftle.

“I think it was just my teammates, they always find me when I’m open,” Murphy said, not taking much credit for her own performance as the team continues to mow its path through a tough schedule. “We’re taking it one game at a time. We’re focusing on us.”

Spallina himself would not have said it any other way.

“We’re worried about Oregon,” he said about Saturday’s game against the Ducks. “That’s it. Next week is next week.”

Spallina and staff will not let the Seawolves get ahead of themselves and show any vulnerability whatsoever.

“One slip up, you prove everybody right,” he said. “Right now we just want to prove everybody wrong.”]]></content:encoded>

This kicked off a series of 15 practice sessions which will conclude with the Frank Conti '11 Memorial Spring Game on April 25. HEATHER KHALIFA / THE STATESMAN[/caption]

The Seawolves are far from charging out of the tunnel with the fight song blaring or the smell of grills fired up in the parking lot, but football season is here. Well, the spring version is anyway.

Stony Brook head football coach Chuck Priore and his staff opened spring practice on March 24, which is the first of 15 sessions that the coaching staff will have with their players on the field.

This string comprising of 11 7 a.m. practices, along with a pair of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. sessions concludes with the Frank Conti ‘11 Memorial Spring Game on April 25 at 2 p.m. at Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium.

This is the first season that the game is being named after the former graduate who died suddenly working his summer job four summers ago. He was 23 years old.

The 2015 version of this Seawolves team is young, but that does not mean they are inexperienced. 13 players on the roster are seniors, but 24 players started a game in red and white uniforms last season.

The offense loses a couple key pieces, in wide receiver Adrian Coxson and running backs James Kenner and Marcus Coker. The quarterback position also seems to remain in question, as Conor Bednarski was shaky last season. They do, however, return explosive running back Stacey Bedell.

The defense remains mostly intact, with Victor Ochi continuing to wreak havoc on opposing offensive lines. However, Priore will have to find a replacement for his do-it-all man last season, Christian Ricard.

The Seawolves will open the season with another Thursday night matchup, this time on the road, taking on Toledo on Sept. 3.]]></content:encoded>

The Seawolves would go on to beat Sacred Heart 8-4 on Wednesday. <em>MEGAN MILLER / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

Coaches will take a win any way they can get one. But Stony Brook’s Matt Senk was not happy on Wednesday afternoon when umpires decided to call their matchup with Sacred Heart after 6.5 innings.

“There’s never enough at bats,” he said. “It’s about playing as much as possible.”

They got what they needed early though, as the Seawolves put up a seven-spot on Sacred Heart starter Connor Landers in the bottom of the first, and held on for an 8-4 win at a rainy Joe Nathan Field.

“I’m pleased with the fact that we ended up winning, but we’re early in the year and trying to figure some things out,” Senk said.

Stony Brook starter Tim Knesnik allowed only one baserunner in the top half of the first, who was promptly picked off by catcher Cole Peragine on a 1-2 pitchout.

Knesnik was chased from the mound in the top of the second inning, when he allowed three of the first four batters to reach base. Even on a day which he was supposed to only go a couple innings, it was still an early exit for the junior.

“We were going to try and get him through two innings then get him out, but it did not work out that way,” Senk said. There was also a problem with Knesnik’s back going into the matchup, so extra caution was taken in taking him out.

The offense gave him all the runs he would need though, as Johnny Caputo, Casey Baker and Toby Handley would crank out two-run hits in the bottom of the first. Jack Parenty drove in the first run of the game with a single after the first two batters reached base, and the onslaught was just getting started.

Only one batter, ironically the designated hitter Malcolm Nachmanoff, did not reach base for the Seawolves, as 19 of the 35 total at bats resulted in somebody reaching base.

Both Peragine and Handley were perfect reaching base on the day, going 4-for-4 in that aspect but only totalling 3-for-3 in the box score. Each player drew two walks, with Handley also getting hit by a pitch.

Sacred Heart was able to cut the lead to 7-3, with three Pioneers players getting base hits in three different ways. Dan Shock ripped an RBI single to left-center, scoring Keith Klebart. Jesus Medina then got hit by a pitch with the bases loaded and Alex Perry drew a walk with the bases juiced.

Zack Short cut the Seawolves lead to 7-4 in the fifth when he drilled a 1-1 pitch from Edwin Corniel over the left-field fence, but Stony Brook answered in the bottom half of the inning with a run of their own. Andruw Gazzola was able to draw a bases-loaded walk, scoring Peragine to make it 8-4.

The umpires got together after this inning to debate calling the matchup, but that motion was denied. They got their say an inning and a half later and cancelled it, much to the dismay of both Senk and Sacred Heart manager Nick Giaquinto.

“I’ve been doing this a long time, and you think you see it all, but that’s one I haven’t seen before,” Senk said.

Stony Brook will take on the UMass-Lowell River Hawks in a three-game series this weekend at a hopefully drier Joe Nathan Field, with a doubleheader Saturday. The River Hawks took a pair from Stony Brook in their three-game set last season in Lowell, Massachusetts.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Softball sweeps Central Connecticut State in home debut</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the first home games of the season on Wednesday, the Stony Brook softball team swept a double-header against Central Connecticut State.

The wins improved the Seawolves’ record to 9-8, putting them back over the .500 threshold. Although they have yet to begin conference play, this doubleheader represents a major momentum shift after a somewhat slow start.

"It's always great to play at home and get two wins on your home field," junior pitcher Jane Sallen said.

The first game was a pitcher's duel. Sallen took the mound for the Seawolves against Central Connecticut's Laura Messina, whose .60 ERA is amongst the top five in Division I.

Stony brook junior Shayla Giossa got to Messina in the 1st with a solo home run, her fifth of the season, to put the Seawolves up 1-0.

This would prove to be all of the offense the Seawolves would need for the day, as Sallen shut out Central Connecticut, allowing just three hits in a complete game effort.

"Jane threw a real good game," Seawolves Head Coach Megan Bryant said. "It was a classic pitchers battle but we just did what we needed to do."

Although Sallen’s dominance on the mound is what shows up in the score, the Seawolves victory was once again given a major defensive boost by Giossa in the fifth inning. With two outs and a runner on third, she robbed Central Connecticut’s Kat Malcom of an extra base hit as she collided with the centerfield fence to make an over-the-shoulder catch.

“Our team worked throughout the game to get better every inning and that’s what we did,” Sallen said.

“She came up clutch for me because that was obviously not my best pitch,” Sallen said. “I knew she would make the catch.”

As it came time for the second game, the weather conditions became a factor. Rainy conditions caused the infield to become noticeably muddy, which became a concern for some players.

“The conditions were less than desirable in the second game,” Bryant said.

The first few innings of the second game looked to be even lower scoring than the first. Central Connecticut sent Messina to the mound once again to face off against Stony Brook ace Allison Cukrov. The score was 0-0 until the Seawolves scored two runs in the bottom of the fourth.

A three run home run by senior Bria Green appeared to put the game on ice for the Seawolves, who lead 5-0. However, what looked like a sure win soon came into doubt when Cukrov allowed six runs in the sixth inning. After she struggled, Bryant sent Sallen back to the mound to relieve her embattled ace.

“Allie [Cukrov] was cruising until that sixth, “Bryant said. “She has to learn to be a little stronger when conditions are not ideal.”

After failing to score in the sixth inning, Stony Brook came out swinging in the seventh. A few base hits and a walk loaded the bases for freshman Chelsea Evans, who delievered in the clutch with a walk off double to win the game, 7-6.

“I knew we had to get those runs in so when I got a good pitch I swung as hard as I could,” Evans said after the game. “I wasn’t going to go down swinging.”

Beating one of the best collegiate pitchers twice in one day seems to indicate that the Seawolves sub-.500 start will be behind them come conference play. If Stony Brook can stay hot come against America East opponents, the team appears to have the offensive and defensive pieces necessary to make another run at a conference title.

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stony Brook’s Division of Information Technology will be working with the IT department of Dowling College to fix network issues at the Brookhaven Residential Village of Dowling’s campus over spring break.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since the fall semester, Stony Brook’s DoIT team has been aiding Dowling in fixing the network issues at the Brookhaven Residential Village, or BRV, even though it is not Stony
Brook’s facility.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The overall throughput speed was first increased from 25 Mbps (megabits per second) to 100 Mbps, the maximum speed possible. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SBU DoIT found that the connection of 100 Mbps from Oakdale, the main Dowling campus, to Brookhaven is insufficient.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lightpath, a subsidiary of Cablevision, manages the link between the two campuses, Brookhaven and Oakdale. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Brookhaven Residential Village was acquired from Dowling College for use the first time this academic year.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Approximately 200 Stony Brook students call the gated facility their home.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The student body here is made up of transfer students who are guaranteed housing on the main campus during the next academic year.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Students take a bus back and forth to get to class 20 miles away from where they live in Shirley.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Internet is a basic necessity for students and as all the denizens of Brookhaven Residential Village get off the last bus of the day, connection problems occur. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Brookhaven is over 15 miles away from Dowling’s main Oakdale campus, but it is still under the same Wi-Fi network as the Dowling campus.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With everyone on the Internet at once, the network becomes saturated during peak hours. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When students are plugged in with ethernet cables, they do not have issues with the network.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Additionally, during the day when most students are normally at Stony Brook’s campus, there are no Wi-Fi issues.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But as the assistant director of Campus Residences Henry Joseph put it, when everybody is on the network, the connection issues are almost like gridlock traffic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Like during rush hour, everyone is leaving at the same time and trying to go to the same place. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“It’s really hard to get your information back and forth because you’re all colliding with each other,” Joseph said. “The more you collide with each other the longer it takes to get your packet back.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Similar to a traffic accident, in the digital world it takes longer for those collisions to clear up and create a path for information to move freely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Like drivers honking their horns, students hit refresh in an attempt to see faster results, but this actually makes the connection worse.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By doubling the connection speeds from 100 Mbps to 200 Mbps, the lanes are essentially widened, giving people more room to navigate the Internet.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You’re not going to be going 60, 70 miles an hour, but at least you’re not stuck,” Joseph said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the meantime, students were given suggestions to help get their homework done, such as using the SINC sites while at Stony Brook and the computer labs back at the Brookhaven dorms.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“A lot of people say that we should just get work done on campus, but realistically you would like to get work done in your room,” China Bailey, junior health sciences major and resident of Brookhaven Residential Village, said. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

Roosevelt East River Drive on Oct. 30 2012 after Superstorm Sandy. <em>PHOTO CREDIT: DAVID SHANKBONE</em>[/caption]

Hurricane Sandy, otherwise known as “Superstorm Sandy,” engulfed the east coast of New Jersey and New York in late October of 2012. It is the second deadliest hurricane in U.S. history, and the areas affected by the storm are still suffering from <span style="line-height: 1.5;">the consequences.</span>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Dr. R. Lawrence Swanson, associate dean of the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences at Stony Brook University, led an investigation that examined the different waste infrastructures affected by Hurricane Sandy with three handpicked members of the SoMAS community: Robert Wilson, Ph.D.; Bruce Brownawell, Ph.D.; and graduate student Kaitlin Willig. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The investigation was a joint effort called Resiliency Institute for Storms and Emergencies and included members from New York University, Cornell College and the City University of New York. Each college focused on different areas damaged by Hurricane Sandy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The purpose of the investigation was to access all the damage caused by Hurricane Sandy, as well as facilities that could be vulnerable in the future, in Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk counties. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Nassau County has the most amount of damage because that’s where the greatest storm surge was,” Swanson said. “It was worse around the Long Beach area.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Swanson explained that figuring out the extent of damage to the environment due to the Bay Park Sewage Treatment Plant in East Rockaway was “the bulk of the work.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Bay Park plant is the largest facility that handles sewage in Nassau County, processing 50 million gallons per day.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bay Park has a low elevation, and due to the severity of Superstorm Sandy, the sewage pipes that lead up to the plant were completely submerged underwater, which resulted in almost twice the amount of discharge of minerals and sediments, such as nitrogen, into Reynolds Channel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The facility was shut down for two and a half days following Superstorm Sandy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“After the plant came back online, it was so badly damaged that it couldn’t pump normal sewage,” Swanson said. “The pumps were not strong enough.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When Bay Park reopened, the facility was processing 100 million gallons of sewage per day.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">The sewage was transferred to the smaller plant Island Park, located several miles away from Bay Park.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“It took about a month and a half to get the Bay Park plant functioning,” Swanson said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Back in 2011, Swanson surveyed the Bay Park plant with two of his colleagues and concluded that there were problems with the plant.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They made a recommendation to local and state officials urging them to move the location of the sewage system in Bay Park to the ocean.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Bay Park plant has been in that location since the 50s.</span></p>
<p class="p1">“[The original builders] could not have picked a worse place to put a sewage outfall,” Swanson said.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Swanson and his colleagues, who also worked on the RISE investigation a few years later, said that the total max daily load (TMD) had exponentially increased and was posing a threat to the surrounding areas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“New York State government determines who will do the TMD calculation.” Swanson said. “The entire process could take three to four years after the report is initially done.” </span></p>
<p class="p1">“It could take five to ten years to complete the job,” Swanson said.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Bay Park plant poses a danger to local fisheries, endangered species and the water quality on Long Island and Jones Beach.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The scope of the problem becomes that much greater,” Swanson said. “Before we can move forward, we need to know what it [moving the plant] is going to do to marine resources, such as Surf Clan, one of the largest remaining fisheries in New York State.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You have to understand the potential ecological damage,” Swanson said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When asked about what Stony Brook students and the community can do to help expedite this process, Swanson said, “The public should play a very active role to let officials know what their feelings are….If you live there, write to your public official.”</span></p>

Or if you were, you did not go outside, which no one can blame you for, because there is nothing to do and no one around." <em>HEATHER KHALIFA / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

Spring Break, right? When you are younger, society sells it to you as a great time where you and your peers flock down to Miami or the Jersey Shore in droves for a week of hedonistic debauchery. Or maybe you just go home, see some friends, visit the old high school and chill out for a week.

Sounds great, right?

Well, not everyone makes it off campus for this much-needed vacation. As you spend more time at Stony Brook, you come to learn the undeniable truths of this university: the food is super-expensive, the bus app is unreliable more often than not and the campus is dead on the weekends.

Now take those three things and make them constant issues for about a week and you have an accurate representation of what spring break is like on campus. I had to stay because I was scheduled to be on duty in my building and let me tell you, this is not somewhere I would want to spend my break.

Dining was a huge issue. For some reason, the only dining hall open was the SAC, and it was only open from about 7:30 a.m. to 7  p.m. Now, I can understand cutting down on services in anticipation of a severe lack in on-campus students, but this was a bit much, and it was a problem not helped by the fact that I had to be in my building's college office from 5 to 11 p.m. each night.

Luckily, I found a couple of other people to order take out with, which I truly believed they saved my life.

And if you think the campus is dead on the weekends, you have never been here over the Spring Break. Or, if you were, you didn't go outside—which no one can blame you for because there is nothing to do and no one around. Walking around campus in the hours before my shift started, I saw only a handful of students, usually walking alone and clutching a bag of food from the Student Activities Center, undoubtedly for later because the SAC closed so early. I imagined I felt the way the characters on The Walking Dead feel when they find more survivors.

What’s arguably worse is how empty the buildings get. The only time I've been more creeped out my residence hall is when I was here until the day of Graduation last year. All my suite-mates left and so did most of the building. It was not a fun time.

But over Spring Break, it’s different. You know there are at least some other people on campus, you just don’t see them. Like ever. Nothing made me more uneasy than having to do rounds several times a night through an eerily quiet building. I only ran into people twice during my rounds and both times I was more surprised than I should’ve been to see them.

The only—and I mean only—saving grace was the super-secret events that happened on Friday. You see, the university is aware of these short comings and as a way to make it up to us they decided to have a huge event on Friday. (Unfortunately, it wasn’t advertised because the administrators ran out of print quota.)

But it was wonderful. They had bouncy castles and inflatables in the SAC plaza, catered food from Ten89, Cabo Fresh and O Sole Mio; there was even popcorn, cotton candy and a table where you could actually meet and see President Stanley. It was an amazing day.

If I were you, and you had a choice in going home or going to Cancun or just leaving campus for Spring Break, I’d take the trip.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_37830" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-37830" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/150325_UnionBikeRack_Manju.Shivacharan_0665-600x400.jpg" alt="MANJU SHIVACHARAN / THE STATESMAN" width="600" height="400" /> The Office of Sustainability removes bikes, deemed abandoned after being left on the racks for more than 30 days, from the racks around Stony Brook University's campus.  <em>MANJU SHIVACHARAN / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

So there I was, walking to The Statesman’s office in the Student Union on the last day of spring break. As I neared the Union entrance, I noticed many bikes missing from the bike racks—including mine.

I immediately thought someone stole the bikes, and I wanted vengeance on whoever did it. But I came to my senses, realizing someone would have noticed something if thievery was involved. So I carried on, because who is really going to help me look for a missing bike on a Sunday?

I later learned that over spring break, the Office of Sustainability removed the bikes from the Union and other locations on Stony Brook’s campus.

It conducted this same operation over winter break for the bike racks around the library; something I learned about from someone I report to at work.

After a quick Google search, I <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/sustainability/biking-at-stony-brook/bicycle-racks.shtml" target="_blank">learned</a> that bikes left on the racks for over 30 days are subject to removal and are deemed abandoned.

I had not abandoned my bike. Mother Nature gave us a beating of snow this year, rendering a bicycle a useless means of travel.

I should not have to move my bike to another bike rack if I am not using the bike.
Without much of a hindrance, I was able to get my bike back by Tuesday from the folks at the Sustainability Office, but at the price of a new u-lock and time to get the bike and lock.
Stony Brook University prides itself on being bike-friendly; we have the Wolf Ride bike share program and dedicated bike locations around campus.

Just this past November, the League of American Bicyclists deemed Stony Brook a Bicycle Friendly University at the <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/sustainability/stories/content/sbu-bicycle-friendly-university.shtml" target="_blank">Bronze level</a>. Then, the big wigs at Sustainability pull this devious move, essentially crushing Stony Brook’s work back to square one.

But I am not someone who creates problems or is a rampant complainer. I am a solution-seeker and a believer in justice. Luckily, I did not have to look very far for viable solutions to this abandoned bike epidemic.

I present you, Office of Sustainability, with two meaningful resolutions to this problem:

1) Post signage about this 30-day policy. Everywhere. If an official at Stony Brook has the audacity to approve the installation of that sign on the ground telling us to look up when crossing the street, then I am sure the least that can be done is post a sign about this policy at every single bike rack around campus.

2) Create a registration program for bikes the way the <a href="http://www.transportation.umd.edu/biking_registration.html" target="_blank">University of Maryland</a> has. I am an out-of-state student from Maryland, and I usually compare the problems Stony Brook faces with the solutions University of Maryland proliferates. UMD, after all, has been awarded a Bicycle Friendly University at the <a href="http://www.umdrightnow.umd.edu/news/umd-named-gold-level-bicycle-friendly-university" target="_blank">Gold level</a> by the League of American Bicyclists.

Let’s not re-invent the wheel, but instead learn from the works of others and improve it. The transportation white-collars at College Park require cyclists to register their bike.

In the event it is stolen and found, it can be returned to the rightful owner. My brother went to UMD and he used the same bike I use. The UMD Department of Transportation Services sticker is still on the bike to this day.

Incorporating both solutions should be easy. First, get the signs installed. Informing the public about this idiotic policy will give you protection from lawsuits and angry students. Second, create an online database of registered bikes on campus.

I am sure the sophisticated, experience-hungry computer science students of Stony Brook can help create one, and if not, pitch it as a senior design project for computer engineers.

I am certain they will be thrilled to help you out.

All you need to do is provide the cyclist a permit or sticker, which would attach to the bike. And plus, because this is an online solution, you just saved paper, and therefore, trees.

Talk about being sustainable.

But please, for the love of all things good, do not call this program “Wolfie-[something]” or “Wolf-[something].” I am confident to say some of us Seawolves are tired of Wolfie this, or Wolfie that. Leave Wolfie to athletics.

If you still think it is the best idea to round up theses bikes to clear up the bike racks, fine. Add to the growing number of bikes you have collected.

But if you think it is time to solve this problem with real solutions, bravo, you just stepped into the 21st century, where being responsible is the way to go.

What you decide to do is up to you, but do not forget to involve the University Police, the facilities and management departments and anyone else you see fit in your quest for a solution to this problem.

If spring break was that slow for the staff members at the Sustainability Office that you guys decided to round up the abandoned bikes, the very least you could have done was notify the public before you did anything. I digress.

I think you should expect a bill of $50 for my new u-lock.

I am sure you guys had a titillating time while removing my old one.]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Boobs &amp; Bras was held in the SAC in Ballroom B. Students were able to decorate a paper-shaped bra during the event.</b></span></p>
"Melons." "Fun bags." "Jugs." "Milkshakes." A wide variety of students, brought together by an important topic, shouted out stereotypical nicknames for breasts.

Simple posters with no more than some pink writing and a black bra advertised an important night of the semester for many women on campus—the event Boobs &amp; Bras. Boobs &amp; Bras facilitates open conversation about positive body image and empowerment as well as sheds light on the promotion of breast health.

This year, senior psychology major Mallory Rothstein and resident assistant Alexa Goldstein hosted the event with help from Jennifer Islam, another resident assistant who contributed from Italy, where she is studying abroad.

In preparation, the three hosts created a survey in which taboo—but important—questions, such as ideal breast size, self and societal perception of breasts and knowledge of breast health, were asked.  The results were used as speaking points for the night’s student and staff panel.

Goldstein, a junior, was inspired by last years Boobs &amp; Bras event and decided she needed to take part in its growth and preparation for this year. She aims to empower people through education.

“Breasts have been so sexualized that it has come to a point that it reflects self esteem,” Goldstein said. “So people's breast size relates to their confidence and we believe that it's not about the size you wear, it's about how you wear your size. We believe that no matter what size, we want you to feel good about it.”

Rothstein, Goldstein’s fellow host, was active in the event's conception last year and has since been crucial in the success of Boobs and Bras.  Rothstein felt it was important to remember that breasts are not just a focal point of sexual interactions.

“Through education of the biology, when you should start doing self exams, people are going to be really empowered to take care of their body a lot more and ultimately not be ashamed of their breasts and whatever size they are,” she said.

As the program's participants sat around 13 tables, which seated about eight people each, the keynote speakers Jean Tully and Karen Dybus, both physicians assistants at Stony Brook University, asked one person from each table to stand. They then proceeded to state the alarming statistic that 1 in 8 people in the United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer. Participants looked around the room as the severity of the statistic set in.

Then Tully and Dybus quizzed their audience as they debunked common myths people often believe about breasts. They urged the audience to take control of factors that can lead to better breast health such as diet, exercise, weight and stress and anxiety, to name a few.

To end the night, the event's hosts played a video showing student models as they celebrated what their breasts meant to them. Both male and female participants exuded confidence as they share their trials and triumphs with their breasts.

Joanna Donaldson, both a volunteer at the event and a model for the video, is a sophomore on the pre-nursing track at SBU.

“Girls, whatever size your boobs are you have to be confident, you have to show it off, so I think this is a really nice event that promotes to love yourself.  I think that it is so important for college students,” she said.

The event also included the fact that men are overlooked when it comes to breast health, even by men themselves. On the tables were pamphlets detailing breast health awareness for both genders.

Rothstein hopes to see the event grow to be even larger in the future. She said another higher education institution has already reached out to her with the hopes to create a similar program and sense of awareness at that school. As the event continues to grow, the future for women’s breast health awareness and positive self image will become a more talked about and accepted topic.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>My break up with Tinder</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_31262" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="size-large wp-image-31262" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Tinder_Manju.Shivacharan-67731-1024x682.jpg" alt="MANJU SHIVACHARAN / THE STATESMAN" width="600" height="400" /> Tinder, the popular dating app, rolled out Tinder Plus, which offers new features but with a price. <em>MANJU SHIVACHARAN/THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dear Tinder,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last semester, I wrote an article raving about how you were the greatest app I’ve ever had the experience of downloading. But now, in light of some new information about your change in features, it may be time that we had a talk.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I want to say that it is not you, but me. But it’s 100 percent you, and it is time we break up.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This year, you introduced Tinder Plus, the same app as before but with new features, like being able to swipe on people in different locations as well as undo accidental swipes to the left. Normally, I would be cheering from the hilltops that these features have been added because, Tinder, you are my bae.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Except for the one major flaw you made in the update: I have to pay for it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tinder, we have been through so much together for it to end like this. When I was falling asleep from boredom in class, you were there for me. When my legs were about to give out while waiting in line for the Express bus, you supported me through it all. When a date would go poorly and I would lose all hope in finding love you were there, waiting for me with a plethora of beautiful college men to make me think otherwise.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Now look at you, you are suddenly a big-shot. According to CNN you attract one million new users every week and make 22 million matches per day in 140 countries. I get it, you are growing and you need your space, but do you need to monetize the simple act of meeting new people? You want me to pay for your new features?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">You cannot even be fair in the pricing that you designed. In the U.S., those under 30 pay $9.99 a month, while those over 30 have to pay $19.99. Your spokeswoman, Rosette Pambakian, explained the price difference was done because younger users, who are usually in college or a working a first job, do not have a lot of money during this period in their life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am not going to disagree completely with that statement, seeing as a small part of me dies inside every time I go to the pump to fill up my car, but ten extra dollars a month just because you are older? That is a bit of a spike.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yes, I am aware that you are telling people they do not have to pay for these new features and can stick with the same old, free Tinder app. BUT YOU ARE A DIRTY LIAR, TINDER! As incentive to get users to upgrade, you started putting limits on how many swipes right, or “likes,” people can use during a certain period. Once users exceed the allowed number of swipes, a screen pops up saying they have to wait an additional 12 hours before they can swipe again.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I cannot believe you are doing this to me, Tinder. I understand your desire to grow as a company and the business genius behind charging for something that is already in such high demand. I guess I just thought you were better than that. I thought you were above adding fees to something that was once free of charge. But I thought wrong.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For now, I will still continue to use you every day, getting in my fair share of free college boys. Until I hit my swipe limit of course and have to wait my 12 hours to go back on.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">I wish you all the best with your new direction (even though I really do not).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Sincerly,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Emily Benson.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

One popular event during Islam Awareness Week is "Scarves for Solidarity." For an entire day, Muslim and non-Muslim women wore the <em>hijab</em>, a traditional head covering, and then reflected on their experience at a dinner that night, sharing personal stories on why they participated, and what it meant to them.

		<title>College Gal Cooking: cheesy shepherd&#039;s pie with scalloped potatoes</title>

During the Middle Ages, eating game, mutton or pot pies was a popular English tradition. According to Food Timeline, these pies were slowly cooked.

It was not until the introduction and acceptance of potatoes in the United Kingdom that Sheperd’s Pie became popular. Cook’s Info said that this dish probably originated in Scotland and Northern England after potatoes were accepted in the UK after 1870. This dish was made with minced lamb meat.
<p class="p1">This dish is a classic comfort food, especially around holidays like St. Patricks Day. So in honor the recently-passed St. Patty’s Day, this week’s College gal cooking is a cheesy twist on a classic dish.</p>
<strong>Ingredients:</strong>

<em>1 box Cheesy or regular Scalloped Potatoes</em>
<em>1 box mashed potatoes (optional)</em>
<em>⅓ cup milk</em>
<em>½ cup hot water</em>
<em>Corn salsa</em>
<em>Ground Turkey</em>
<em>Crackers (optional)</em>
<em>Salt</em>
<em>Black Pepper</em>
<em>Garlic Powder</em>
<em>Parmesan Cheese </em>

Start with the ground turkey. You can season the meat with your desired amount of salt , black pepper, garlic powder and Parmesan cheese either before or after you put the meat into a pot to cook. Set the stove on medium heat to cook the meat.
<p class="p1">Crumble at least five crackers and add them to the meat as it cooks. The crackers will prevent the ground meat from crumbling when cooking. The crackers also add some more flavor and texture to the meat.</p>
<p class="p1">Break up the meat with a spoon as it cooks in the pot. While the meat cooks, prepare the sauce for the scalloped potatoes. The scalloped potatoes will be the top level of the pie. If you want to make a four level pie, prepare the mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes will not only be under the scalloped potatoes, but it will also be a barrier between the corn and meat and the sauce for the scalloped potatoes. The scalloped potato sauce can seep into the layers of the pie and overpower the flavors of the bottom layers.</p>
<p class="p1">Be sure to monitor the meat, which should turn light brown once finished.</p>
<p class="p1">Once the meat finishes cooking, grab an oven-safe container. Cover the bottom of the container with a thick layer of meat. This will be the first level of the pie. Then, add a layer of corn salsa. From there, you can choose whether you add mashed potatoes or not, depending on your preference.</p>
<p class="p1">If you use the mashed potatoes, place a layer of the potatoes above the corn before adding the scalloped potatoes. Once the scalloped potatoes are placed on top of the mashed potatoes, add the cheese sauce to the top of the dish.</p>
<p class="p1">For this version of the recipe, set the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Place the dish into the oven for at least 20 minutes or until the top is golden-brown.</p>
<p class="p1">Without the mashed potatoes, add a layer the scalloped potatoes to the corn. Then, pour the cheese sauce over the dish. The sauce will seep into the bottom layers of this pie. Place the pie in the oven for  20 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit or until golden brown. Keep an eye on the dish while its in the oven. The sauce will bubble upwards as it cooks.</p>
<p class="p1">Once your pie is done, take out of the oven and let it stand from several minutes to cool. Then, grab a spoon or fork and dig in.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Streetlight Manifesto concert that was supposed to be held on Jan. 29 has now been officially rescheduled to Monday, April 20.

The concert, which is not the annual spring Brookfest show, will be in SAC ballroom A at 8 p.m..

As reported by <em>The Statesman</em> earlier this semester, the initial concert was cancelled due to a mishap with the contract between the band and the Undergraduate Student Government.

Those who previously signed up for tickets through the Google form that was distributed in January will have priority when it comes to obtaining tickets this time around.  Emails regarding those tickets will be sent out later this week. Those who did not originally sign up for tickets in January can sign up through a USG Google form that linked to on the event's page.

Student-band Nice Shot, Kid will be the opening act.

		<title>(Un)popular Opinion: First Amendment protects speech of SAE members</title>
		<link>http://sbstatesman.com/2015/03/29/unpopular-opinion-first-amendment-protects-speech-of-sae-members/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Words are the way we communicate our thoughts and pass judgement. The thoughts and attitudes of men can be filled with vitriol, hatred and evil. Sticks and stones may break our bones, but words can cause deep psychological damage. Words hurt. However, words can cause as much delight as pain, and that makes it a much different weapon than a gun or a blade.

Where the regulation of a weapon serves solely to prevent damage towards your fellow man, limitation of speech gives people the power to control expressions of opinions. Such a power can represent a violation of the most basic rights our forefathers fought and died for.

Recently, members of Sigma Alpha Epsilon demonstrated how corrupted their thoughts were by displaying an incredible amount of racial hatred in a video leaked online of the members joined together in an amazingly offensive chant. They faced swift punishment by means of the fraternity's immediate disbandment and expulsion of two members.

The fraternity absolutely deserved the disbanding, as such hatred has no place in a civilized organization. However, I don’t believe the two students should have been expelled.

As important as it is to preserve freedom of speech, it’s important to note that such a freedom doesn’t come without consequence. When your speech guarantees consequences from a public institution, I believe that starts to represent a dangerous infringement of our rights.

A landmark case in 1969, Brandenburg vs Ohio, is similar to the situation today. In that case, the organizer of a KKK rally, who wanted to spew the same hatred and ignorance that the SAE students spread, faced punishment from the Ohio government for his hate speech. Yet, the Supreme Court ruled that his hatred, as horrible as it was, was protected speech.

In the SAE case, the punishment came in the form of expulsion rather than criminal charge, and it was delivered by a public university rather than the government. Even if such a punishment is legal, I believe that morally, speech should still be protected. As a public university that takes your tax dollars to survive, they should have to be held to a higher standard of protected rights than a private institution.

Hate speech like this is a form of an unpopular opinion, and when you start giving public institutions the right to limit those opinions, you set a dangerous precedent.

This type of punishment demonstrates the ability of a government to leverage its capacity to collect tax money to limit the rights of its citizens. Such hurtful words may damage the reputation and image of a public university. However, as soon as the school started to survive on the taxes of its people, its image became the face of its people. This issue is vital to the Stony Brook community.

The principles set forth in this instance gives our school the right to expel someone for saying, “Stony Brook sucks.” Admittedly such an occurrence would face significant and instant backlash, but the basic principles behind it are the same as the case in Oklahoma.

Both are examples of speech that damage a university’s reputation and are things that a private institution could be free to punish, but the government cannot.]]></content:encoded>

MEGAN MILLER / THE STATESMAN" width="600" height="338" /></a> The Center of Excellence in Wireless and Information Technology, above, will be home to two of the five companies that are joining the Stony Brook START-UP NY zone. <em>MEGAN MILLER / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Five start-up companies and businesses have relocated to Stony Brook University just ten months after the initial launch of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s START-UP program.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The five companies are a part of a new group of ten New York companies that will invest nearly $40 million and have committed to create upwards of 267 new jobs over the next five years in tax-free areas sponsored by Stony Brook, SUNY Cobleskill, Rochester Institute of Technology and Hudson Valley Community College, according to a press release from the governor’s office. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since the launch of the START-UP NY program, a total of 93 companies have joined the program and created over 2,800 new jobs, according to the press release.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Brite Home LLC, AJES Life Sciences LLC, Theragnostic Technologies Inc., STS Global Inc. and SynchroPET Inc. have all found a home in and around the Stony Brook community. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“They’re involved in a lot of things we’re involved in, like next-generation networks and cyber securities,” STS Global CEO David E. Hershberg said. “It’s good for a company that’s just getting started to have the capabilities that the university has for us to take part in.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hershberg’s company is a new telecommunication and media solutions business that aims to provide custom products, networks and services that leverage known applications with wireless technologies. Located in the Center of Excellence for Wireless and </span>Information Technology in Stony Brook’s Research and Development Park, STS Global develops customized systems to help wireless technology companies broaden their capabilities with a strong focus on satellite-<span style="line-height: 1.5;">based technologies.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">He founded Globecomm Systems Inc. in 1994 and was CEO of the company for 19 years before it was sold for $340 million. He has given lectures at the College of Business and is also a member of one of the committees of the dean of the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute graduate gave plenty of credit to Yacov Shamash, who is vice president for economic development and the dean of the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Stony Brook. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I think [the engineering department is] second to none on Long Island and, as far as I’m concerned, in the entire state,” Hershberg said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Long Island native Marc Alessi is bringing his company, SynchroPET, under Cuomo’s program as well. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It helps give a company an edge in an environment where sometimes you have some competitive disadvantages on Long Island,” Alessi, a former state assemblyman, said. “You have a startup that has a better chance of succeeding.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">His company is an existing pre-revenue biomedical device manufacturer that specializes in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanners. This technology was invented at Brookhaven National Laboratory, so Alessi jumped at the opportunity to commercialize this product. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Here I found products that could be really helpful and they were sitting on a shelf,” Alessi said. “Our products can help with cancer research, Alzheimer’s research, Parkinson’s research and also diagnostics and treatment.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The company, which will be located in the Long Island High Technology Incubator, will target small animal research
companies first. Alessi lost his third general election by a half of a percentage point in 2010, but he said his true calling has always been in start-up businesses. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I’ve always been an entrepreneur,” Alessi said. “I’ve always had the mindset that I like taking a problem and get a tremendous amount of satisfaction when I know I solved it and did a great job at doing it.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Along with Alessi’s company, AJES Life Sciences and Theragnostic Technologies will also be located in the Long Island High Technology Incubator. AJES’s mission is to provide preclinical and toxicology services for new pharmaceuticals, while Theragnostic will focus on commercializing new biomedical and healthcare technologies developed at Stony Brook.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">BriteHome LLC will join STS Global in the CEWIT building, developing a new home automation system that will encompass new secure wireless networking technologies that are already in use by most Wi-Fi hotspots and routers, which are common devices in households across the United States.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

Shamash, above, is stepping down as dean of the school to become a special advisor to SUNY Chancellor Zimpher for STEM Education and Research. <em>WAYNE COOPER / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For Harold Walker, director of the civil engineering program at Stony Brook, Yacov A. Shamash is a “straight shooter.” Shamash’s successful funding efforts helped establish the civil engineering program at Stony Brook University in 2012.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The program’s first graduates are expected in 2016, but companies on Long Island are already “lining up to hire them,” Walker said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“They are eager for our students to start coming out from the pipeline,” Walker said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Shamash recently announced that he will step down as dean of the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences after leading the school for more than two decades.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The challenge for the new dean, who is expected by the fall of 2015, will be to maintain the momentum of the program and to continue expanding research without compromising quality.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Shamash’s decision came after he was appointed as the special advisor to the State University New York Chancellor, Nancy L. Zimpher, for STEM Education and Research.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He is leaving behind a legacy of advanced programs and growth in the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences faculty size and student enrollment. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I am proud of where the college is and where it came from,” </span>Shamash said. “We’ve seen tremendous transformation of the college, from expanding research to increasing the number of students that are coming in.”</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During Shamash’s tenure, the CEAS undergraduate enrollment more than doubled and the faculty was increased by 45 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Three new Ph.D. programs have been created in computer engineering, biomedical engineering and technology, policy and innovation. His funding accomplishments helped engineering across the board. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I’ve worked with a lot of deans, and I’ve seen a lot of different styles,” Walker said, “What I really appreciate is that he is always trying to do the best for the College of Engineering.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While serving as dean of Harriman School of Management and Policy (now known as the College of Business) from 1995 to 2003, Shamash was directly responsible for the establishment of the MBA program.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He was also actively involved in the creation of SUNY Korea, the first American university in Korea. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Shamash will continue to serve as Stony Brook University’s vice president for economic development.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He also holds a pivotal role in the START-UP NY program that helps create, expand and relocate businesses.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since both the demands of the program and new companies are growing, he decided to step down as dean of the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences after almost 23 years to focus on the new job.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“It was time to get someone else,” Shamash said. “I have another hat and this other hat needs a lot more attention.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The next dean will have to face the challenge of “managing the incredible growth that we’re seeing in engineering while at the same time finding resources that are becoming more scarce,” Walker said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Built upon the success of Dr. Shamash in building CEAS, the new Dean will need to propel CEAS to national prominence and ranking,” Dr. Imin Kao, professor of the Department of Mechanical Engineering and an associate dean of the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the major parts of Shamash’s legacy, according to Walker, has been the outreach to industries and especially on Long Island.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Across the country, local, state, regional and federal governments are looking for universities to be the catalysts for the economic growth.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Dr. Shamash left CEAS which has been growing both in quality and quantity in the last two decades, with incoming students having the best quality ever, and research grants increasing more than six times over the years,” Kao said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Yacov is a valued colleague and leaves a lasting and important legacy at Stony Brook through his leadership in the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences,” Stony Brook University President Samuel L. Stanley Jr. said in a press release. “I look forward to working with him to continue to build our Economic Development initiatives including START-UP New York and all of the excellent programs currently in place, much due his vision and insight.”</span></p>

BASIL JOHN / THE STATESMAN" width="600" height="503" /></a> Commuter Student Services &amp; Off Campus Living offers legal housing options for students who do not want to live in on-campus dorms. <em>BASIL JOHN / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When electrical engineering Ph.D. candidate Mahdin Mahboob came to Stony Brook University last August, he started looking for off-campus housing that he could afford on his salary as a teaching assistant.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mahboob, who is from Bangladesh, found a lead on a room but said he was denied the rental because he is not East Asian.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The landlord was contacted for this story, but did not comment, stating she did not understand the request for comment. <i>The Statesman</i> is choosing to withhold the name of the landlord mentioned in this story in order to grant anonymity to a tenant of that landlord. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mahboob said he sent the same landlord multiple text messages after receiving her phone number from a current tenant, and received the message “I only speak Chinese” as an explanation as to why he would be denied an available room. The tenant told him that the owner cannot speak English. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mahboob is not the only Stony Brook student facing this issue. Other SBU students claimed to have been denied off-campus housing, allegedly due to a language barrier, but said they did not report it for different reasons. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Landlords may not refuse to rent to, renew the lease of, or otherwise discriminate against any person or group of persons because of race, creed, color, national origin, sex, disability, age, marital status or familial status,” according to the Tenants’ Rights Guide from New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. This is expressed in Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, otherwise known as the Fair Housing Act. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The tenant, a junior biology major who wanted to remain anonymous due to concerns of being kicked out of her rental room by her landlord, lives in a house in which the landlord allegedly only takes in tenants who are East Asian, or those that are Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Malaysian or Vietnamese. The tenant advertised an available room on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/408036005873739/" target="_blank">the Facebook page for Off-Campus Housing</a>. Mahboob said he was denied a room in that house. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The tenant that said although her landlord is not able to communicate fluently in English, previous communications between the landlord and the tenant can be understood.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I found it really weird,” Mahboob said. “I haven’t seen this before. I mean, this university generally is very diverse so...renting out rooms or houses to students, to say, ‘I prefer only certain ethnicities?’ It’s not a good idea.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mahboob said he eventually found a room to rent and moved in December. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I could have moved off-campus sooner if I hadn’t been in this situation,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When asked if he considered reporting the landlord, Mahboob said he did not because he later found a rental.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Even if I did report it, I don’t know what benefit it would have done to me,” he said. “I don’t even know where to report it. The housing office or the police? I don’t know.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Alvin Mdachi, a sophomore technological systems management major from Kenya, said he faced a similar struggle in his search for a place off campus.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He said he started looking for a place to stay at the end of the fall 2014<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>semester at Stony Brook, having studied at SUNY Korea the year before. Two days after joining an unofficial off-campus housing group for Stony Brook students on Facebook, he said he found someone offering a room for the entire winter break for $500. He saw the room in person, but later received a message that the landlord wanted a Chinese tenant, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Facebook group is not connected with the university’s housing and apartment listings, according to Emily Resnick, assistant director of Commuter Student Services and Off-Campus Living.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Facebook group is where Stony Brook students can leave posts if they are looking for rooms to rent or advertise available rooms. The advertisements often mention price, whether or not utilities are included, the rental duration and distance from the university’s main campus or South P lot.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mdachi said he contacted another member of the Facebook group, only to have the same happen. He was invited to see the available room and was told the next day that it was too small to add more people, he said. However, he saw the the tenant ad</span>vertise the same house in the group and decided to comment on the post, “I thought the house is too small so not for lease.”</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">He said he soon received this message: “So far we [haven’t] rented out the place, but the landlord insists on finding someone Asian.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mdachi said this happened to him a third time before he eventually found a place to stay off-campus through a friend.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mdachi did not report his situation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I just never took it so serious,” he wrote. “So I just kept it with me but I shared with some of my friends and they just felt sorry for me.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">He said he never had direct contact with a landlord, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I never had contact with them, just the renters who were sincere, and they also felt sorry for me.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What was supposed to be a debate over two potential resolutions—one in support of a tobacco ban on Stony Brook campus and one against it—turned into a conversation about how to best implement such a ban and how to help students quit smoking at the Undergraduate Student Government senate meeting on Thursday, March 26.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">James Alrassi, the USG executive vice president, proposed both resolutions as a way to let the senate decide which side of the university-wide debate over tobacco to take, but by the end of meeting, neither resolution was brought up for a vote. The senate discussion came in the midst of <a href="http://system.suny.edu/healthaffairs/tobaccofree/" target="_blank">a SUNY-wide effort</a> to ban tobacco use, including smoking and chewing tobacco, on all SUNY campuses.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The university hasn’t made any indication of what the ultimate goal is,” USG Vice President of Academic Affairs Steven Adelson said. “They’re trying to reach out to different groups on campus to get an understanding of what people’s thoughts are, and once they have a vision, I think we should take a stand, but I don’t think we should take a stand now without really understanding what the vision is because the vision hasn’t been established yet.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ahmed Belazi, the director of planning and staff development in the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs, said his office is also trying to reach out to students to get their views on a possible tobacco ban.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We want to be as inclusive and as effective as possible,” Belazi said. “We don’t want this to fail. We don’t want this to be something that works just a little bit. We want to make sure this is something that addresses as many identities, as </span>many thoughts and as many issues <span style="line-height: 1.5;">as possible.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Alrassi said he was in favor of the use of designated smoking areas and a “balanced and regimented implementation of the program as opposed to going cold turkey particularly with banning cigarettes smoking all across campus.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One issue that the senate discussed was the enforcement of not only a potential tobacco ban but also Stony Brook’s current smoking policy, which bans smoking within 25 feet of all buildings.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I know as an RA [resident assistant], we’re supposed to enforce the 25 feet,” Sen. Nathan Blazon-Brown said. “Sometimes smokers will back up and be like ‘Is this 25 feet?’ It’s not as ambiguous if you draw a yellow circle in the ground and say ‘This is where you can smoke.’”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another topic of discussion was ways to help students quit smoking.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“It is a habit; nicotine is a physical addiction,” Alrassi said. “You can’t expect people who have been smoking for a number of years to just outright quit.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He pointed out that nicotine gum and patches are available for free at the Student Health Services office.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You can get training to do anything,” Sen. Marissa Peterson said. “I’m trained to give EpiPens and CPR, so I’m sure if all the RAs had to go through a few trainings to be able distribute Nicorette or whatever, that would be pretty cool.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In June 2012, the SUNY Board of Trustees adopted a <a href="http://system.suny.edu/media/suny/content-assets/documents/healthaffairs/Tobacco-Free-SUNY.pdf" target="_blank">resolution</a> that called for legislation to ban tobacco use on all SUNY property by Jan. 1, 2014. But <a href="http://sbstatesman.com/2013/09/03/suny-tobacco-free-policy-goes-up-in-smoke/" target="_blank">no piece of legislation regarding the resolution has passed</a> in the state Senate or Assembly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="One%20bill introduced by Assemblywoman Deborah Glick" target="_blank">One bill introduced by Assemblywoman Deborah Glick</a> in 2012 was not considered by the Assembly Higher Education Committee. <a href="http://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?default_fld=&amp;bn=A07277&amp;term=2013&amp;Summary=Y&amp;Actions=Y&amp;Votes=Y&amp;Memo=Y&amp;Text=Y" target="_blank">Another bill from Assemblyman Walter Mosley</a> was reported from the Assembly Higher Education Committee in 2013 but was not considered further by the Assembly Codes Committee. <a href="http://open.nysenate.gov/legislation/bill/S4853B-2013" target="_blank">A bill sponsored by Sen. Kemp Hannon</a> was not considered by the Senate Higher Education Committee.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Several SUNY schools—SUNY Oswego, SUNY Cortland, University at Buffalo and Erie Community College—have already implemented tobacco bans without state legislation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stony Brook University President Samuel L. Stanley Jr. <a href="http://sbstatesman.com/2014/09/23/stanleys-possible-tobacco-ban-still-smokey/" target="_blank">has expressed support of a tobacco ban on Stony Brook’s campuses</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The only Stony Brook campus that is completely tobacco-free is the east campus, where the Stony Brook University Hospital, the Health Sciences Tower and the Long Island State Veterans Home are located. The east campus tobacco ban has been in place since 2009.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

And Assistant Chief of Police Eric Olsen stressed the importance of surveillance cameras to the campus community.  STATESMAN STOCK PHOTO</em>[/caption]

The number of security cameras on campus has increased as part of a prolonged effort to deter crime, according to a Stony Brook University Senate report.

There are over 1,500 cameras currently installed on campus, and Assistant Chief of Police Eric Olsen stressed their importance.

“Video surveillance enhances the safety of the campus community,” Olsen said. “Time after time video has played a large part in solving crimes all over campus.”

The report also included the annual Clery Report data, which summarizes campus crime over the past year and compares it to years prior. The Clery Act requires that schools “must collect, classify and count crime reports and submit statistics to the U.S. Department of Education,” as well as make the data public.

Recent data showed that crimes are down for the eighth consecutive year.

Popular areas of crime, like burglary and drug arrests, have declined significantly in recent years, according to the 2014 Annual Security and Fire Report. On Stony Brook’s main campus, there were 96 recorded accounts of burglary in 2011 but only 25 in 2013. In that same time span, the number of drug arrests went from 49 to 15.

Though it is hard to conclude a definitive correlation between the increase in cameras and decrease in crime, Olsen said the surveillance plan began in 2007, the first year of declining crime.

“The increase in video surveillance across the campus was a pro-active measure undertaken by the University Police in conjunction with other departments to enhance the security of the entire campus community,” he said. “We continue to expand into areas where we feel the safety of our community would be enhanced.”

Assistant Chief of Police and Director of the Office of Emergency Management Lawrence M. Zacarese said he is confident that the camera systems have helped deter crime.

“There is definitely a link between the number of cameras and the enhanced technology we are using and the number of crimes we are able to successfully investigate, make arrests and close,” Zacarese said.

Zacarese said campus security camera projects are a part of an “ongoing assessment of the general safety and security of campus.” He added that large public universities require high-tech security systems and for Stony Brook UPD, the more cameras, especially in less patrolled areas, the better.

About 200 cameras were on campus in 2007, and Olsen said of the current 1,500 plus cameras, “virtually all of them are on one platform accessible to the University Police.” He also noted that the long time period makes the question of cost difficult to answer.

Zacarese pointed to the university’s features in industry security magazines and at different security conferences to emphasize Stony Brook as a “model university” in the world of security.

“Cameras are just one piece of what I would describe as a robust, multi-modal, physical security system on campus,” Zacarese said. “Our goal is safety for the students, faculty, staff and entire campus community all day, every day.”]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Hampton Bays seeking sustainable solutions from SBU professor</title>

Marc Fasanella, professor of ecological art, architecture and design in the Sustainability Studies Program at Stony Brook Southampton, has started a monthly lecture series for the Hampton Bays Civic Association called “Downtown Hampton Bays: Its Future, Present, and Past.” The Hampton Bays resident  is using his platform and career experience to outline a list of plans for the hamlet to tackle its long-standing ecological issues and become more sustainable.

“My lectures are an open discussion, a forum where people in the community can voice their ideas about the Hampton Bays in front of town officials,” Fasanella said.

A long-time Southampton resident and an on-and-off member of the Architecture and Design Forum since 1992, Fasanella said he originally came to the town to teach at the former Southampton College, now Stony Brook Southampton.

“Think globally, act locally,” Fasanella said. “That’s how I’ve been raising my kids for the last 17 years I’ve been here.”

He referred to the Bays as an area with great potential because of the amount of parcels —schools, the post office, the library, movie theaters and the train station—located on Main Street. Historic sites and interactive spaces like the Pine Barrens Nature Preserve and Southampton’s vast waterways are just a short, “bike-worthy” distance away, Fasanella said.

With his background in sustainability studies and his personal history with the town, Fasanella said that the Hampton Bays Civic Association does not have any power per se, but it has been responsible for preserving land and giving people ideas as to what other municipalities are doing to keep their towns sustainable.

Fasanella said he wants to see the hamlet revert back to its fishing and farming roots, and he would like to see the Bays rekindle its getaway-style feel.

Hampton Bays had small farms and many fishermen at the turn of the 20th century, unlike most massive farms on the East End, Fasanella said. In fact, it was originally a huge farmland and has one of the biggest fishing ports to this day. Its fishing history, farming history and beach culture succeeded when people had disposable income, Fasanella claimed.

He spoke about the movement to bring back farming and agriculture and the fact that “the town is bought as per community preservation funds, some of which have buildings on them….People can come in and run a farm on that land.”

Another issue he is tackling is the fact that the “Bays are all toxic on [the] East End because of fertilizers and pesticides.” He said septic tanks are now pushing waste into the waterways.

“We have to stop using septic systems,” he said. “Over the next 50, 100 years, we should have fewer houses that are big and close to the water…fewer bulkheads, [but] we want to have more housing and denser housing right near the train station, far away from the water, near the sewer district.”

He said Southampton must separate the storm water from the septic system, which is just below the ground and pushes septic water towards the bays.

“The thing that scares people is that there’s houses there [on the beach],” he said. “Well, there may not be in 50 years. We have to say ‘You can build another house, but you can’t build it there. We’ll pay you from the community fund.’ This was done during Hurricane Sandy…done every time they want to build highway, bridge, etc. It’s not always going to look the same.”

He emphasized that the public has to start looking at waterways as public parcels. The water’s edges are especially important, according to Fasanella, because there are so many roads that go into water, polluting it with antifreeze, runoff, plastic and so on. He said Southampton must create some sort of “buffer zone between the edge and road.”

“More and more people are commuting to Hampton Bays from the city, from jobs,” Fasanella said. With this density increase of people, the community is faced with pressures of “people living in illegal and substandard rentals, [whereby] pay goes down and prices go up.”

Fasanella also suggested that the hamlet become a more pedestrian-friendly environment.

“In the summer I park my truck and unless I need to go far, barely use my truck,” he said. “Everyone parks their car and walks the entire summer.”

In terms of transit-oriented development, he urged for an increase in bus and train services, co-housing, rentable houses and smaller houses.

“Some of the wealthiest people have these small houses,” he said, referring to the example of the highly demanded summer cottages at Fire Island.

“Another charm is ‘pocket neighborhoods,’” Fasanella said. “Put a couple cottages behind one acre of land (closer to the train station), and you’re not increasing density, just avoiding a situation where people are illegally renting out basements.”

Another issue he spoke about was creating what he calls “equalizable corridors” for coyote, deer and the like. Without these corridors, he explained, the animals become inbred and develop deformities. He stressed that every school should have ecological preserves for ecological study.

“The Hampton Bays is an ideal place for all of this,” Fasanella said. “We have to change the way we create the built environment.”]]></content:encoded>

While Mother Nature made it snow on a frigid Saturday afternoon, Dorrien Van Dyke and company made it rain goals against the visiting Oregon Ducks at Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium, as the No. 12/8 Stony Brook women’s lacrosse team notched its ninth-straight win of the undefeated season, 16-3.

“It was brutal,” Van Dyke, a sophomore who led the team in points last season, said. “We’ve played in every condition you can imagine. Whenever it’s snowing in practice coach always screams, ‘It’s our weather!’He really makes it our mentality that we can play in any type of weather.”

The entirety of the game, which was delayed by over an hour as facilities used a Bobcat plow and plenty of shovels to clear the snow-covered field, was played under constant precipitation. That did not stop the Seawolves’ intensity on either end of the field, though.

“I think it was a good team win for us. A lot of people got in off the bench,” Van Dyke said. “We just really were rolling, we were hitting each other and finishing our shots.”

Although Stony Brook’s offense has the potential to pour it on more, the group did a good job of converting on its opportunities, scoring on 16 of its 26 shots in the game. The game was reminiscent of last season at LaValle, as Van Dyke and classmate Courtney Murphy led the assault.

Van Dyke scored four goals while dishing out three assists, as Murphy put five shots in the back of the net, assisting on a goal by junior Taylor Ranftle as well.

“We were just seeing each other getting open,” Van Dyke said on her connection with teammates in the game. “One person would cut and the follow cut would be wide open, and we would just trust each other to finish and bury it.”

Ranftle continued her solid season on Long Island after transferring from Virginia, scoring two goals while assisting on two more.

Freshman sensation Kylie Ohlmiller did her usual scoring parade as well, notching three in the goals column while also dishing two assists on the day.

After being a major contributor last season, sophomore Kristin Yevoli has not been in the spotlight quite as often with the team’s firepower, but she performed well in front of the hundred or so fans in attendance against the Ducks. She scored two goals on five shots while assisting on another.

“Oregon is an opponent that came into the game with a lot of wins and that we did not know much about,” Head Coach Joe Spallina said, before heading out to the first practice of the season for his other team, Major League Lacrosse’s New York Lizards. “They do a nice job. It was an interesting matchup for us.”

The team has little time to revel in their success, however, as the Seawolves are already focusing their attention on a big week of America East games.

The spotlight is turning solely to their next game against Binghamton on Wednesday.

“I think the big focal point for us is us. One game a time,” Spallina said. “It’s a little cliché, but it’s what we talk about. It’s who we are.”

For Van Dyke, despite the team’s undefeated record and wins against high-profile teams, every game is a big one going forward in the season. That starts with Binghamton and Albany this week.

“It’s a very big week. We’re looking to win both of them hopefully by a lot and just keep rolling and finishing the season well,” she said.]]></content:encoded>

No one circles the wagon like the Seawolves. After falling behind 3-1 to start the game, the Seawolves came back to beat the Vermont Catamounts in Burlington, Vermont 21-12.

The Seawolves have shown an ability to go on runs just at the right time. Their ten-goal game changer in this contest was jump started at the end of the first quarter by freshman midfielder McLean Chicquen, igniting a strong performance by the Seawolves.

The second quarter was dominated by Stony Brook.

Brody Eastwood continued the run started by Chicquen, scoring a goal off an assist by senior midfielder Mike Rooney.

Rooney got his second assist of the quarter three minutes later, passing it to sophomore midfielder Ryan Bitzer, who scored his fifth goal of the year.

The Catamounts finally got on the board with a goal by senior attackman Dyson White to end the half 13-4 in favor of Stony Brook.

The second half was much more closely contested, as Vermont looked to make a comeback.

However, the Seawolves started off on another scoring run.

This time it was sparked by Rogers’ fourth goal of the game. Bitzer scored his second goal and just seconds after was followed by Rooney’s second.

The third quarter ended on a high note for Vermont. Michael Clarke scored his first goal of the game and Ian MacKay his second.

Eastwood’s fourth goal gave Stony Brook a ten-goal lead that the Catamounts would never come close to challenging.

The Catamounts managed to outscore the Seawolves 3-2 in the fourth quarter, but it was not enough to mount a comeback.

Rooney’s 11 points on the day, three goals and eight assists, paced the Seawolves in the victory.

He continues his tremendous season, as Rooney now has 67 points to lead the Seawolves on their America East run.

On Wednesday, Adrian Coxson and other former Stony Brook football players who graduated in the fall, as well as those who will do so in the spring, have the opportunity of a lifetime to prove themselves.

They only get one shot: Stony Brook’s Pro Day.

NFL teams will be sending representatives to Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium to look at what will likely be a handful of Seawolves who will complete a workout in their last opportunity to show professional scouts that they deserve a chance to continue their football career at the next level.

“When Pro Day comes around just remember at the end of the day it’s football,” former Stony Brook standout wide receiver Kevin Norrell said. “Don’t put any extra pressure on yourself, just go out there and have fun.”

Norrell was a Seawolf who took plenty of advantage of his Pro Day opportunity, running the 40-yard dash in 4.53 seconds, according to Rotoworld, an NBC Sports affiliate. He would later be picked up by the Buffalo Bills as an undrafted free agent before eventually getting released.

However, the student-athletes will not just have to run. Other drills, such as the three-cone drill, broad jump, vertical jump and more, are all part of a typical Pro Day workout.

Wide receivers like Coxson will have to show their in-play talent as well.

“I know he’s going to run very fast, he has to show off his routes, catching, attention to detail and the scouts will take notice of that,” Norrell said. “If he gets drafted that’s amazing. If not, that’s ok too.”

As all of the Seawolves prepare for their workouts, each works with any available tools they can in order to perform at their highest level. There are no more chances to run faster, jump further, leap higher or anything of the sort.

This is it, and Coxson has someone in his corner who has been through it all.

Former Super Bowl Champion Qadry Ismail has worked with the Maryland native since the end of Stony Brook’s season.

“I think for Adrian he’s done an exceptional job of understanding how to be ready to perform for his Pro Day,” Ismail, who was known for his speed in the NFL, said. “What I’ve seen is he is every bit of a very good, fluid moving, very fast young man with the size.”

Everybody has a chance to get faster and stronger, though, and the duo has taken every moment they can to do just that.

“You’re trying to be like a fighter jet coming off an aircraft carrier,” Ismail, who ran track during his time at Syracuse University, said. “If you could be like a fighter jet coming off that aircraft carrier, well you’re going to have a very short runway.”

That is the essence of the 40-yard dash. Wide receivers in the NFL have a short amount of time to burst past the defensive back covering them, so scouts want to see just how fast they can be.

“You’re trying to violently, as much as you can, explode out and really just explode into the ground and push away through the ground and eventually you’re coming up and now you’re just floating in the air,” Ismail said. “There’s a whole lot that goes into something as simple as that, but that’s the trick of it all,” he added.

For Coxson, he knows that after his workout, only one thing will matter: what the scouts see on their stopwatch.

“My goal and my mindset is to beat the clock,” he said. “That’s basically what you’re doing, racing against the clock.”

For all the Seawolves who lace them up on Wednesday, that is exactly what they will need to do if they want more of a chance to achieve their dream in the NFL.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_38079" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-38079 size-full-width" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/LIFE_CMP-DRYFRAT_2_KC-600x397.jpg" alt="KANSAS CITY STAR / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE" width="600" height="397" /> Sigma Alpha Epsilon was recently disbanded after a video leaked of members at the University of Oklahoma saying racist chants. <em>KANSAS CITY STAR / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1">Today’s American youth makes up quite possibly the most liberal and open-minded generation this nation has ever seen, but the recent transgressions of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity at the University of Oklahoma has the entire nation second-guessing the future of American society.</p>
<p class="p1">On Tuesday, March 10, the Washington Post published an article regarding the now-infamous SAE chapter and its distasteful, racist video that went viral earlier that week.</p>
<p class="p1">In the video, SAE brothers are shown in a coach bus singing a racist chant to the tune of the nursery rhyme “If You’re Happy and You Know it.” It warped the innocent prose of the children’s song into something incredibly insensitive that started like this: “There will never be a n****r in SAE.”</p>
<p class="p1">Eugene Volokh, the man responsible for the WaPo article, thinks the speech is a constitutional right and that the brothers should not have been expelled. While I agree that the SAE brothers are legally protected, their expulsion was well deserved and agreeable.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Volokh frames his argument as to why OU President, David Boren, expelling the men responsible for the racist chant is not justified on the premise that what they said is protected by the First Amendment. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">The truth of the matter is that freedom of speech includes the right “to use certain offensive words and phrases to convey political messages,” according to the United States’ Official Court website. What the SAE brothers did was exactly that. They were offensive to express a political message. It does not matter if anybody agrees. </span></p>
<p class="p1">Believe it or not, you can say what the young men in the video said, record it and post it on the Internet, and there would be no legal basis to convict you of any crime.</p>
<p class="p1">The second argument Volokh presents is that the speech made by the SAE brothers can be equated to “students talking to each other about...how Hamas has it right,” or “black students talking...about how all whites are racist, and white cops...should get shot.”</p>
<p class="p1">He makes the argument that all of the aforementioned speeches make for a hostile environment for the parties involved. If Boren expelled the fraternity brothers for doing just that, why has he not expelled the students who express radical Islamic views or the black people who call for white people to get “a taste of their own medicine?”</p>
<p class="p1">This is where I have my qualms. Volokh seems to be ignoring the type of organization that we are dealing with here—a fraternity, not a cult, religious or activist group.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Fraternities, despite their recent bad publicity (most of it brought upon themselves), are organizations that were founded upon, or are maintained upon, the values of non-discrimination and social excellence. They are, in most universities, organizations that are subject to the rules of their respective universities. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Any chapter of any fraternity or sorority is permanently associated with its university, and vice versa. Thus, when it comes to expelling the SAE students, there is nothing wrong with what the OU president did. </span></p>
<p class="p1">The school has every right to defend the image that these fraternity men directly damaged.</p>
<p class="p1">An argument can be made along the lines of this: if the fraternity brothers get expelled, why don’t the members of the college campus that openly express their disapproval for the homosexual community or marginalized group receive the same treatment? It is because these discriminatory organizations represent themselves.</p>
<p class="p1">Although they can be part of an institution, they are not organizations that are associated with the university as a fraternity is.</p>
<p class="p1">What the Sigma Alpha Epsilon brothers of the University of Oklahoma did was wrong. What the President did to them is completely justified. It is as simple as that. This is a classic example of a time when different rules apply to groups or people in different circumstances.</p>
<p class="p1">The gravity of the situation is so severe that SAE chapters across the country are staying mum and refusing to comment on the situation or those who were involved.</p>
<p class="p1">I am sure, however, that even many of the current brothers of SAE agree that the makers of the infamous video deserved the punishment they received.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Stony Brook baseball used great starting pitching performances from Tyler Honahan and Daniel Zamora to take two games of a three-game set with the UMass Lowell River Hawks on Sunday and Monday afternoons.

Honahan paced the Seawolves with an ace-like performance in game one that manager Matt Senk has come to expect from the junior, as the lefty went 6.1 innings, allowing only one run and four hits while striking out 13 River Hawk batters in a 10-1 victory.

He had plenty of help on the offensive end, as six different Stony Brook bats drove in a run, with Robert Chavarria bringing in a pair.

The Seawolves persistently put runs on the board, scoring in all but two innings. Senk’s squad put up a pair in the second, fourth, seventh and eighth innings and added a single run in the third and fifth to reach double digits for the second time this season.

It was the first time the Seawolves put up 10 or more since they played Iona on March 17.

In game two, the River Hawks were able to present some offense to help out their pitching staff, putting together a 6-3 victory in the first of a pair of games Monday afternoon.

Seawolves starter Ryley MacEachern struggled on the hill, only lasting 3.1 innings and giving up four runs on six hits.

A big fourth inning propelled UMass Lowell, who took two of three from Stony Brook in Lowell, Massachusetts last season. An Ian Strom single and Jimmy Ricoy double in the inning put the River Hawks up 3-0, with Ricoy scoring on an ensuing wild pitch to extend the margin to four nothing.

Plating another run in the fifth and sixth innings, UMass Lowell had a six-run advantage before Stony Brook made its comeback in the eighth. Toby Handley plated a run with a single, and then Jack Parenty tripled to cut the lead in half at 6-3, but would not be able to crawl any closer.

The rubber match was a pitcher's duel, pitting Stony Brook's Zamora against UMass Lowell's Geoff DeGroot. Zamora lasted all seven innings of the matchup, striking out nine River Hawk batters and only allowing a lone run on a Joe Consolmagno RBI double.

Zamora would not get the win in the matchup, but the Seawolves would with late-game heroics. With runners on second and third and one out, Handley grounded out for the second out. DeGroot and the River Hawk coaching staff chose not to pitch to Parenty, sending second baseman Chavarria to the plate.

Down to his last strike, he laced a single up the middle, scoring Billy McLean from third and Cole Peragine sprinting home from second for the game- and series-winning run.

Stony Brook climbed to 10-11 on the season, and have a busy week ahead on the road. The Seawolves will head to Poughkeepsie, New York on Tuesday afternoon for a one-game stint with the Marist Red Foxes before taking their longest road trip left on the year up to Orono, Maine for a three-game set with the Maine Black Bears on Friday and Saturday.]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was a night of Beethoven and Bach when the Staller Center welcomed the Stony Brook Symphony Orchestra on Saturday, March 28, on the Staller Center’s Main Stage at 8 p.m..</span></p>
<p class="p1">The symphony was conducted by Eduardo Leandro, a Stony Brook percussion professor and the artistic director of its new music ensemble. The program featured Ray Furuta, an internationally-famous flutist and winner of the 2015 Graduate Concerto Competition, as well as a revised original work written by Stony Brook Professor Emeritus Peter Winkler.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even before the concert started, there was an eagerness among the crowd to hear the talents of Futura and Winkler. The Main Stage theater was filled almost entirely, excluding a few single, straggling seats. Staller sold around 1,000 of the 1,050 seats available for the show, almost completely selling out.</span></p>
<p class="p1">The orchestra was set to perform Beethoven’s "Leonore Overture No. 3," C.P.E. Bach’s "Flute Concerto in D Minor" and a concerto with Furuta and Winkler’s symphony.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Just past 8 p.m., the lights in the center dropped, leaving only the soft, yellow light illuminating the stage below. A hush grew over the crowd and everybody sat back in their seats, silent and waiting.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The orchestra began tuning its instruments, creating the illusion of a live beehive, a disorganized but beautiful hum of strings. Each player was like a bee, contributing to the collective buzz growing from the stage. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Luke Balslov, a trumpeter in the orchestra, and Christopher Matthews, a flutist, both commented on how they loved the Beethoven piece the most. Matthews described the piece as “extremely upbeat,” while Balslov said he loved the piece for its great opener, as well as its trumpet solo. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Followed by Beethoven and Bach, Furuta performed a featured solo with the orchestra. Even at his young age, Furuta accomplished a lot with his talent. He is the artistic director and founder of the Silicon Valley Music Festival in San Jose, California, and was named a Cultural Ambassador for the United States by Sister Cities International.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Furuta says he is grateful for all the experiences and opportunities he was given, specifically his family for being there for him and supporting him as he traveled internationally.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Going out of the U.S. to perform is an incredible experience,” Furuta said. “These experiences, just as any, help us to broaden our horizons and grow exponentially. As artists, it is important for us to seek out these types of experiences.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Furuta said he learned plenty here with the Stony Brook Orchestra as well. Because the concerto performed during the show lacked a conductor, Furuta said it was much different experience. </span></p>
<p class="p1">“My leadership skills were challenged and incredibly heightened,” Furuta said. “This is priceless skill as a musician and I am so glad to have gotten the opportunity to perform the concerto in the ‘orpheus’ styled format.”</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Along with the excitement of hearing Winkler’s new symphony, Furuta was a huge reason for the show’s large attendance.</span></p>
<p class="p1">“I was particularly excited to see a flute concerto, those are rarely performed by symphony orchestra let alone university bands,” said Admad Malki, a junior double major in political science and astronomy who attended the show. “Mr. Furuta displayed an exceptional level of emotion and enthusiasm in his performance.”</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After intermission, the wait to hear Winkler’s revised and refurbished symphony was finally over. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Winkler’s symphony premiered in 1979 during the grand opening of the Staller Center, then called the Fine Arts Center. Winkler originally wrote the piece in celebration of his friend David Lawton, artistic director of the Stony Brook Opera. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After retiring from Stony Brook’s music department in 2014, Winkler began making revisions to his symphony. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In defiance of the tradition of not having anybody speak during a concert, Leandro brought Winkler up on stage before the performance of his piece to talk about his revision process. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“It was really a blast to work on,” Winkler said. “Everything is going through different colors, different compositions and eras and forms and ranges.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Winkler’s piece really summed up the show in the final movement. The theme of romance and longing can be heard in the use of the slow string melody, as well in the gently consoling sound of the clarinet and oboe. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“It took me seven years to write [the symphony], the person who started it is not the same who ended it,” Winkler said. “As time went on, and towards the last movement, I started writing more Romantic, which is really what I wanted to write. The last movement is really a love scene.”  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the end of the night, the theme that seemed most noticeable was gratitude. A grateful audience applauded with a standing ovation as the orchestra stood and bowed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The show was very well done, with the formalities of classical concerts observed,” Malki said. “I particularly enjoyed the degree of professionalism by a student orchestra. There were almost no musical mistakes, showing how skilled and well-prepared the orchestra was.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Winkler came on stage as well, smiling and bowing back to the audience with great appreciation. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Furuta was happy with the show as well. Performing is everything to him.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I live for being on the stage!” Furuta said. “So many emotions, energies and thoughts race through your body while you perform the euphoria is really unprecedented every time you play.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

Director Robert Schwentke’s “Insurgent,”’ the second movie of the “Divergent” series, had the targeted audience of adolescents and action movie-lovers glued to their seats with the impressive cast performances and action=packed scenes.

Schwentke brings author Veronica Roth’s second installment of the best-selling series to life, with all members of the original cast returning and the addition of some new faces.

The story begins with events that pick up right where the previous movie left off. Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) is now a fugitive and is on the run from the city of Chicago after freeing members of the Dauntless faction from mind control by Jeanine Matthews, played by Kate Winslet.

Alongside Tris are her boyfriend Four (heo James), her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) and Peter Hayes (Miles Teller). The group was hiding from Jeanine in Amity territory until they were discovered by Dauntless. The group then escapes on a train leading towards factionless territory.

Throughout the movie, Tris has nightmares about the death of her parents and she has fears about what would happen to her brother and boyfriend during all the chaos that was going on around them.  With Jeanine hunting Divergents and trying to keep the faction system alive, it caused a war between the Factionless and the faction system.  She then started to seek revenge on Jeanine and believes that the only way to stop the killings and the faction system is to kill her.

There were a lot of changes to Woodley’s character beyond a new, short haircut. Tris became more courageous and strong as the movie progressed. A scene in which Tris was in a trance and tried to save her mother from a moving, burning building had the audience at the edge of their seats.

Tris and Four demonstrated some romantic moments throughout the movie. Woodley and James continue to show the impressive chemistry on-screen by showing how they would risk their lives to save each other.

One example is when Tris went off and surrendered herself to Jeanine in order to save everyone from being tortured or killed. When Four discovered this, he rushed to the building where Tris was being used to open the box of unknown origins and broke her out her trance before she died.

Elgort’s performance as Caleb was impressive and accurate. His character was so determined about being selfless that he leaves Tris and Four to go somewhere where he could be more useful.

The audience also had a few laughs during the movie, all courtesy of Teller.  His character shined with his rude humor toward his fellow fugitive Tris, for instance, when he said, “Once a stiff, always a stiff.”

Roth’s story in the second book was alluring because the characters reveal more about themselves and the choices they have made. One example is when Four’s mother Evelyn Johnson-Eaton, played by Naomi Watts, is revealed as leader of the factionless and the storyline touches upon on her and Four’s past.

The eye-catching action scenes kept the movie interesting, with gunfights, advanced technology and Tris’ bravery.

The movie’s special effects made the entire story more intense, like the scene where Tris was locked in a trance and she was fighting with herself on top of a building that was falling apart.  The effects of the building being destroyed made the movie more realistic.

Bottom line, “Insurgent” is a must see film for those who want to find some action. If a person is a fan of the best-selling novels by Roth or the acting of Woodley, then this movie is the ideal choice.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_38086" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-38086 size-full-width" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ENTG-APRILFOOLS-5-MCT-1-600x414.jpg" alt="FAMILYFUN MAGAZINE / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE" width="600" height="414" /> April Fool's day is Wednesday, April 1, 2015. "Personally, I enjoy the passive-aggressive pranks. The small, simple ones that sneak up on a person and smack them in the face with whipped cream." <em>FAMILYFUN MAGAZINE / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE</em>[/caption]

I love April Fool's Day. Everything about the holiday is a wonderful and amazing gift from the prankster Gods. Why? Because college students already do not need an excuse to do stupid, belligerent pranks to one another, so imagine what would happen if you actually gave them a reason to do it.

Personally, I enjoy the passive-aggressive pranks. The small, simple ones that sneak up on a person and smack them in the face with whipped cream. So in case you need any last second April Fool's pranks, here are a few to keep in mind.

<strong>Glitter Bomb your enemies</strong>: Because the world is awesome and occasionally does stuff super right, there is a website out there called “<a href="https://shipyourenemiesglitter.com">Ship Your Enemies Glitter</a>” where you literally do exactly that. This company will anonymously send a person of your choice a huge envelope filled with with glitter so that when they open the envelope, these craft herpes will explode all over everything and never leave. Hope you like glitter, President Stanley.

<strong>Change the time on your roommates alarm clock</strong>: This is a pretty cruel prank if your roomie is one absence away from flunking the course. But if they are students with flawless attendance, or maybe you particularly do not like your assigned bunk buddy, pull the plug on that sucker. It is a good prank, and maybe some of your own personal revenge for his daily 12 alarms at 7 a.m.

<strong>The Nutella poop prank</strong>: Step 1: Go into bathroom stall. Step 2: Wait for someone to use stall next to you. Step 3: Tell person next to you that you are out of toilet paper and ask to borrow some. Step 4: Place nutella on your hand. Step 5: Doing the toilet paper exchange, smear some Nutella on the other person’s hand. Step 6: Cue maniacal laughter.

<strong>Bubble wrap the tires of someone's car</strong>: My friends and I performed this prank last year on my other friend's Jeep. We wrapped his tires super-ninja style so nothing was extremely visible at first glance. There is even a video of him as he is pulling the car out of the lot and his expression going ghostly blank after hearing his car make a sound like 60 little fire crackers going off. 10/10 would prank again.

<strong>Put temporary hair dye in someone'</strong><strong>s shampoo</strong>: Warning: please know what you are getting into if you do plan to execute this prank. If pulled on the right person, the prank is hilarious. If pulled on the wrong person, you may need to be on the look out for some retaliation. Make sure your doors are locked at night.

<strong>Put a bunch of parking tickets on a friend's car</strong>: There is no heart-dropping feeling quite like running to move your car only to see Parking Authority has struck again. So why not run with this? Collect has many parking ticket envelopes as you can and stick them on a friends windshield, only instead of actual parking tickets inside, put a little note inside that says “April Fool's!” This was actually done to me this week—only instead of it being a prank it was real, and instead of a ticket it was a boot on my car. Did you know that if you ignore parking tickets, Parking Authority will get mad? Because I sure didn't.

<strong>Make a fake professor email and cancel class</strong>: I know plenty of professors that contact me from personal gmail accounts with class updates. All you need is a email address similar enough to your professor's and the email address of kids in your class. This is less of a prank and more of you being the hero of the day. Think about it though: if a professor gives a lecture, but nobody is around to hear it, does anybody care?

<strong>Never underestimate the power of a rubber spider</strong>: Every guy loves to act all tough and macho around the ladies, but tangle an itsy-bitsy spider by their ear when they are not looking, and you will see a side of guys you never saw before. Or you may not see them, because there is a good chance they are running for the hills.

<strong>Put masking tape over computer mouse sensors in the library</strong>: This might a bit time consuming, but if you get some friends together, it could make for some great people-watching. Grab some popcorn and a soda and start placing bets over which kid will throw the mouse across the library first. Bonus points if you use cut outs of Nicolas Cage's face as the sensor cover.

<strong>Just have fun</strong>: April Fool's day is all about the observance of comedy, which should be done with laughter and stupidity. If you really want to do the day right, don’t take the jokes too seriously, but don’t use the day to make people feel uncomfortable. April Fool's day is all about having fun, a term often forget around the time of midterms. So be safe, have fun and above all, upload every smack-cam video recording. Happy pranking!]]></content:encoded>

Let me preface this article: I am not an Apple hater, nor am I an Apple fanatic. I do use an iPhone, purely for the reasons of its simplicity.

Apple products are known for simplicity, and that is what the soon-to-be-released Apple Watch is not. I mean, what do you really need in a watch? Well, let’s first define the word “watch” (noun): Based on Merriam-Webster Dictionary, a watch is “a device that shows what time it is and that you wear on your wrist or carry in a pocket." The Apple Watch does fit in the definition, but its other excessive features are really not necessary.

Here are five reasons why you should not buy the Apple Watch:
<ol>
	<li>The price: The Apple Watch starts at $349. This is actually absurd because the iPhone is almost half the price of the Apple Watch. The base price is for the Apple Watch Sport. There are other options, such as the Apple Watch (wow, such a creative model name) starting at $549 and the Apple Watch Edition, featuring an 18-karat gold case, starting as low as $10,000. Really? You might as well buy six 1oz gold bars and a cheap JCPenney Casio wristwatch, because that seems like a better and wiser investment. Oh, and its cheaper to do so.</li>
	<li>The Apple Watch can only be used with the iPhone to activate all of its features. Great! You can now answer your iPhone from your watch, because Apple knows you are too lazy to reach through your pocket when you receive a call.</li>
	<li>Charging: Seriously? Who in their right mind had the concept of charging a watch? If you are like me, you probably have a ton of adapters for all your contraptions like your phone, laptop, speakers, fan, trimmer, your other fan, et cetera. What sane person would agree to have an unnecessary adapter—especially for a watch—in addition to the current collection they already have?</li>
	<li>It shows time. You already have a phone that shows time. Not only does it show time but it takes and receives calls, gives directions, tracks your health, downloads apps and stores music. It also fits conveniently in your pocket. Why would you want some other accessory, which in fact accessorizes your phone that does the same things, if not less?</li>
	<li>Not only is it a horrible investment for you, but it is also a cruel one. There are children around the world that have barely anything to eat while you raise your exultant smile when the Apple employee hands you your purchase. You would be less abominable if you threw $349 on the street. It is littering but it is a deed.</li>
</ol>]]></content:encoded>

On a wet Tuesday night under the lights at Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium, senior men’s lacrosse player Mike Rooney gave the ball up to teammate Brody Eastwood for one of his six goals on the evening at 11:33 of the second quarter.

Not only did that assist and his overall performance in the game keep Rooney entrenched among the nation’s leaders in points, but it also gave the Long Islander his 200th career point for the Seawolves in the team’s 17-9 win over Quinnipiac.

“It feels good, I’ve worked hard for four years so it’s nice,” Rooney said about the accomplishment, acknowledging that it is not about his individual performance on the field. “I’m just really focused on playing as best I can for the team and helping out as best I can.”

Rooney may not take credit for his jaw-dropping start to the season, but he has done more than just show that he can play lacrosse. The East Islip-native is making everybody around him better, as evidenced by his three assists to go along with another four goals.

“It’s awesome,” Eastwood said of Rooney hitting the 200-point milestone, becoming the fourth player in program history to do so. “I actually had no idea until you guys said it, but that’s unreal. I’m really happy for him.”

Sophomore Alex Corpolongo gave Stony Brook a one-goal lead with a long range shot just before the break, but Rooney helped put the nail in the Bobcats’ coffin with two goals in the first 7:19 of the third quarter that Quinnipiac would never be able to recover from.

Over the last couple of seasons, Rooney has only gotten better, steadily improving from 42 points his sophomore year, 53 last season and now 63 points, with six regular-season games and presumably postseason play still to come.

“I think that’s really been the good thing to see with Mike, just his maturity,” Head Coach Jim Nagle, who saw the first Seawolf under his lead reach the milestone, said. “Clearly he’s playing his best lacrosse at the end of his career, which is good to see.”

It was not just the team’s leader in assists who excelled in the game, though. Sophomore faceoff specialist Jay Lindsay turned in another impressive performance, winning 18 of 24 faceoffs while also scooping 13 ground balls and dishing an assist in the win.

“He was dominant on faceoffs,” Nagle said about Lindsay. “He’s another guy, he’s improved so dramatically on his ground ball play that he’s really turned himself into a real good player.”

Rooney used the perfect terminology to describe how the Seawolves, who have won seven of their last eight games and earned the most victories for a Stony Brook team since 2011, have played so well.

“I just feel like we’re clicking,” Rooney said. “We’re working hard in practice, we’re carrying over onto the field, and we’re just playing hard really, that’s what it is.”

It is working for the Seawolves, who next confront a Princeton team ranked in the top-15 in the country in every poll at home on Saturday at 3 p.m..]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Coxson and Tye lead Stony Brook football performances on Pro Day</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Never before has a Stony Brook football player been selected in the NFL Draft—ever. Yet when the Seawolves took to the indoor practice facility at All Star Arena in Coram for Pro Day, they may have very well earned that chance.

Leading the way were standout wide receiver Adrian Coxson and tight end Will Tye, both of whom posted workout times rivaling, if not beating, those of the top-performing players at the NFL Combine just a month and a half ago. In a league where speed means everything, their workouts could play a huge role in how the next month plays out.

Coxson, who trained with former Super Bowl-winning wide receiver Qadry Ismail at the Arena Club in Bel Air, Maryland in the months leading up to Pro Day, put on an impressive running display for six scouts, including one from the New York Jets, in the 40-yard dash.

“We had six and that’s all we needed,” Coxson said. Times of 4.33 and 4.42 seconds were impressive enough, but according to Ismail, multiple people at the finish line using approved stopwatches clocked the second and slower run at 4.28 seconds, which would have matched the top time of any player invited to the combine. Coxson not just hitting but exceeding his goals shows the pay-off that has come from working with Ismail.

“It was just more so continuing to go over the technical things of running the 40 that we’ve been going over for the past three months,” Coxson said, mentioning that over time it has gotten better and better, and more so a matter of, “getting it down and getting comfortable with it.”

After his performance at Pro Day to go along with a career in which he totaled 1,425 yards and 11 touchdowns, Coxson earned private workouts with NFL teams ahead of the draft.

“Next week I have the Jets and Giants, I have the Ravens and I should be getting a few more,” the third-team All-Colonial Athletic Association team selection said, adding that all the hard work he has done paid off. “It was more so just taking my time just to do what I’ve been doing in practice with Qadry for the past three months and just plan it all and just put it down for one day, which is Pro Day.”

With blazing times, a player rumored to be signed as a free agent after the draft may now have caught some eyes to warrant a selection towards the end of the selection process.

“I’ll tell you what, I am over the moon excited for him, because everything that we felt he needed to do, he just went out and did it," Ismail said about his pupil. "He stuck to the plan that we had set forth and man, that was an A-plus-plus performance."

As Ismail, who played for 10 years in the NFL, made specific note of, it was arguably most impressive that Coxson was not only able to run the 40 yards in 4.33 seconds the first time, but that he came back and on some clocks, at least, ran even faster.

"That's muscle efficiency at its finest," Ismail said. "He just dominated the day, caught every pass thrown his way. Dominated the day is how I would describe it."

In case the point did not come across from a man who was a track star in college himself, Ismail made sure that everyone knows how special Coxson's moment was.

"Wow, just dominated the day," he said. "I cannot emphasize it enough. Dominated the day."

Tye, a second-team All-CAA selection who transferred from Florida State, laid down equally if not more impressive times in the 40-yard dash, also throwing his name into the mix to sign or get his name called come draft day.

At the combine, the fastest time run by a tight end was 4.58 seconds, but Tye blew that out of the water with both of his Pro Day times. He finished in 4.47 and 4.50 seconds for his two attempts, making him the fastest tight end in this year's draft class.

Though those times, like everything clocked at Pro Day, are unofficial, all teams with representatives in attendance spoke to Tye after the workout, with his wide receiver-like times grabbing plenty of attention.

The New York Jets, New York Giants, Kansas City Chiefs and Denver Broncos are the teams that will be holding workouts with Tye as of now, and he already worked out with the San Diego Chargers, according to DuWayne Upton, Tye's agent.

In CBS Sports’ NFL Draft Prospects rankings, Tye is the No. 24 tight end in the upcoming draft, and No. 460 player overall, which will likely move in a positive direction after Wednesday's performance.

The NFL Draft runs from Apr. 30 to May 2, after which teams are free to sign those who have not been selected.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_38166" align="alignleft" width="500"]<img class="size-full wp-image-38166" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/DSC_0692-e1395710704849.jpg" alt="STATESMAN STOCK PHOTO" width="500" height="332" /> Junior Jane Sallen (above) took the mound in the second non-conference game against Rutgers on Wednesday afternoon.

Stony Brook softball dropped both ends of a home doubleheader to Rutgers on Wednesday afternoon, losing 7-5 and 1-0 at University Field.

The losses mark the Seawolves' first in nearly a month, as Stony Brook came into the day riding a six-game win streak.

"Rutgers is the toughest opponent we've had in a while," Stony Brook coach Megan Bryant said.

For the first game, Stony Brook sent senior Allison Cukrov to the mound, while Rutgers started junior Dresden Maddox.

The first game began with Rutgers and Stony Brook exchanging solo home runs in the first. Scarlet Knights outfielder Jackie Bates hit one well over the outfield wall before outfielder Bria Green tied the game for the Seawolves.

“The long ball was good to us in the first game,” Bryant said.

After letting up the home run to Rutgers, Cukrov retired the next eight batters she faced until Bates took her deep again in the top of the fourth inning to put Rutgers back on top 2-1.

"[Bates] is a good hitter, she put a good swing on the ball," Cukrov said. "It wasn't my best pitch."

After a home run tied the game for Stony Brook in the fourth, the Seawolves took the lead in the fifth when Green hit a sacrifice fly.

“I was just trying to help my team,” Green said.

The sacrifice fly gave Cukrov a 3-2 lead going into the sixth inning. However, an RBI double by Jordan Whitley tied the game for Rutgers. Scarlet Knights catcher Liz Adams would later drive home two more runs with a bases-clearing double that put them ahead 5-3.

"I'm not sure you have a reaction to [losing the lead]," Bryant said. "Sometimes games go back and forth."

Rutgers tacked on two insurance runs in the seventh when Whitley hit a two-run home run off game two-starter Jane Sallen. Stony Brook responded in the bottom of the inning with a Green two run homer, but this proved to be too little too late. Rutgers took the first game by the score of 7-5.

The second game was a pitcher's duel. Sallen took the mound for Stony Brook to take on Rutgers’ Shayla Sweeney. Both pitchers carried shutouts for the first five innings, as Sallen and Sweeney engaged in a pitcher's duel.

“The second game was totally different from the first,” Bryant said. “It was really a pitcher’s battle.”

Sallen was able to keep the Seawolves in the game until Rutgers outfielder Carly Todd hit a double with a runner on base to put two Scarlet Knights in scoring position. First baseman Bridget Carr proceeded to<strong> </strong>drive in the runner from third when she hit into a fielder's choice, chasing Sallen from the mound.

The Scarlet Knights would not need any more offense, as Sweeney kept the Seawolves off the board the rest of the way. She completed the shutout, allowing just three hits and striking out eight.

“We need to do a better job at our situational hitting,” Bryant said. “You can live and die by that.”

With this non-conference doubleheader now behind them, the Seawolves will look to get back to their winning ways as they host America East rival Binghamton this weekend.

“[The team] is all chomping at the bit to play conference,” Cukrov said.

Stony Brook is just 1-5 against teams from the "Power Six" conferences (ACC, Big East, Big 10, Big 12, SEC, Pac-12) this season. The lone win came against Purdue in February.]]></content:encoded>

Stony Brook women’s lacrosse Head Coach Joe Spallina was not thrilled with his team on a quiet Wednesday night at Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium when the No. 9/8 Seawolves played Binghamton.

The thing is, his team won 15-2.

“We won and that’s a positive thing, but I wasn’t pleased with our overall performance,” Spallina said, as his Seawolves moved to 10-0 on the season and 2-0 in America East play. “I felt like we lowered our level. It was probably the worst game that we’ve played as a team all season.”

That does not only say something about the quality of this team, but the state of the Seawolves women’s lacrosse program on a whole. No matter the final score, the team still has expectations.

“Stony Brook needs to be better,” he said. “We didn’t perform like a top-ten team tonight.”

One could only wonder what a Stony Brook team in full-bloom will look like. One of the pieces that had not been her typical overpowering-self early on in the season was sophomore Dorrien Van Dyke. Last year’s team leader in points and the second highest-scoring freshman in the country has been good compared to everyone else’s standards, but again, it says something about how good she is when Van Dyke could get better, as she steadily has.

“It’s a good sign, it’s been coming, we talked about it last game but now it’s a consistent thing,” Spallina said about Van Dyke, who now sits in second on the team in goals for the year. “She started off a little tight in the season.”

But, as he would note, after four goals and three assists against Oregon and now five more goals against Binghamton, Van Dyke is showing why she became known as a standout player.

“She’s a superstar in my eyes. A kid that size who can attack the cage the way she does, with unbelievable stick skills, it was only a matter of time before she erupted and kind of got in an offensive groove,” Spallina said. “I’m thrilled for her because I know she was pressing early on and now it’s just consistently she’s putting up some strong numbers and making us a better offense.”

A key against the Bearcats was Binghamton’s attempt to cut off sophomore Courtney Murphy and freshman Kylie Ohlmiller, both of whom have been on a tear all season long. That left a lot of open space in which the Seawolves forced their way into scoring positions rather than fluidly working as a unit, which Spallina would prefer.

“I think it was probably our lowest assist total that we’ve had in a game all season in a game that we scored 15 goals,” he said.

Nevertheless, Stony Brook beat an America East team by 13 goals. There was not a moment when the final outcome was in doubt. So, if the Seawolves were not on cloud nine with their performance, there can only be optimism for how they will come out and attack the nation’s most prolific offense in Albany on Saturday at home.

“When you win 15-2 and you can feel that you’ve really played poorly, I think that’s probably a good sign of where we’ve come in a short amount of time,” Spallina said.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Sexwolf: This just in...or maybe not</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s a bird! No, it’s a plane! No, it’s a giant penis and it’s headed right towards you!

We have all heard the phrase “mircopenis” before and there are many articles that are geared towards people who find themselves stuck between such a pebble and a hard place (ex: back attack, not butt stuff and not the CHE 321 Sn2 reaction).

But a micropenis isn’t the only kind pickle one might encounter during sex. I want everyone to understand extra-large pajama pythons have extra large problems (as well as extra large condoms). You may have heard the expression "fitting a round peg into a square hole." This dilemma is more along the lines of Honey Boo Boo’s mom trying to fit into size 3 jeans.

Most people’s first reaction to hearing about an extra large member is, “make sure you use a lot of lube.” Let me be clear: the people who make claims like this have probably never seen one in real life and, therefore, cannot imagine seeing one. If you’re trying to drive a pickup truck through your front door, no amount of Crisco is going to help. Also, throwing it into fourth gear and slamming on the gas is not a good idea if you want to leave the siding of your door intact.

Drive slowly, my friends, to minimize damage.

I know plenty of people who brag about the size of Mr. Boyfriend’s Mr. Johnson. But there is a difference between well-endowed and over-endowed.

First, what counts as extra-large? I’m not a doctor, yet, but I feel as though I’ve devised a pretty accurate test for how to differentiate. When the Mammoth Mound of Manhood emerges from its denim cage, are the first words out of your mouth “oh no?” If so, you may be biting off a little more man meat than you can chew.

And now I will introduce you to the concept of “uterine ballooning.” I’ll admit it isn’t the sexiest phrase in this article, but the medical community does not seem too keen on creating pleasant terminology when referring to the vagina, such as the term “mucous plug.” Uterine ballooning is the process of the uterus literally inflating off the cervix to allow it to accommodate a little more of whatever you’re into and occurs after much-attended-to foreplay. I promise this is not an excuse to perpetuate the frequency of cunnalingus, but it would definitely help.

If you ever find yourself face to face with a legendary monster, I implore you not to fear. Just remember three simple rules:
1. Slow and steady wins the race. Fast and dirty ends with vaginal tearing.
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">2. Women need to get it up just as much as men do, except “it” refers to the uterus.
</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">3. I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again, when in doubt, use your mouth.</span>]]></content:encoded>

The beautification project, intended to encourage discussion among Tabler quad residents, will be completed in April. <em>RACHEL SIFORD  / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

The Tabler Steps Piano Project will transform the bottom section of the concrete steps into a public piece of art by painting the steps to resemble a Steinway Grand Piano.

The project, which is set to be completed during the month of April, is student based, with student volunteers and coordinators.

“The painting will only occur on weekends to allow students to focus on painting and not classes,” Naveen Mallangada, a sophomore biology major and the creator and coordinator for the Tabler Steps Piano Project, said.

The steps will be painted with black and white outdoor paint. Gold spray paint will be used for the railings and safety lines on each leading step.

“It’s all a matter of students painting the steps as a part of a quad beautification event,” Mallangada said.

The piano-painted steps will stick out like a sore-thumb, but that is the intention.

“I think that the piano steps will create a discussion about our quad,” Kristina London, a senior psychology major and resident of Tabler Quad, said.

The painted steps would better represent the arts, culture, and humanities aspect of the quad, according to Mallangada. “It’s an amazing way to incorporate art in everyday life,” he said. Students in Tabler Quad already have positive reactions to the project.

“It would definitely show people that we’re an artsy quad,”  Jenni Yang, a freshman linguistics major and a resident of Tabler Quad, said. “I think it’ll probably be known as the Tabler Piano Steps once it’s finished.”

The steps, when finished, will create interactive art that students will use on a day-to-day basis.

“It impacts us psychologically, emotionally and adds a sense of whimsy and fun rather than the plain concrete that’s there now,” Mallangada said. He also added that the project could be finished in one-to-two days, but in order to account for weather, they are spreading the project out.

The damage that happened to the stairs during this long winter is currently being fixed by maintenance. Painting can start as soon as this weekend.

The stairs will be painted one half at a time, separated by the middle railing. The half that is being worked on will be closed and taped off while the other section is left open for pedestrian traffic.

The steps are used as the pedestrian entrance into Tabler Quad, leading students in the direction of the Tabler Center for Arts, Culture, and Humanities, better known as the TAC.

“I want this to be something that the whole quad could focus on and come together for,” Mallangada said. “The paint will most likely need to be touched up every spring,” he said, which will add a new tradition to Tabler.

Mallangada originally took the idea to the RHD at Toscanini College, Megan Cale, who then introduced it to the other RHDs and Judy Jaquez, the Tabler Quad Director.

“They were all for it and so enthusiastic that someone wanted to change something about Tabler,” Mallangada said.

Cale and Jaquez were not available in time to comment on the project for this article. The project is currently being paid for by the Dreiser College Hall Council and the Toscanini College Hall Council.

Mallangada also had overwhelming student support while getting the Tabler Steps Piano Project approved.

“I had about five sheets of signed petitions, which is around 150 students showing their approval for the project,” he said. “I think that it will definitely appeal to people who don’t use art because you don’t need experience in art to be involved.”

The project has already has 21 student volunteers.  Once painted, the steps will change the way Tabler Quad is represented to the rest of Stony Brook University.

“It would get the concept of our quad being artistic back into conversations, since you don’t really hear about it after freshman year,” Suha Sheikh, a senior biology major and a resident of Tabler Quad, said.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>SoMAS granted funding to research Millstone Nuclear Facility cooling systems</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_38372" align="alignleft" width="300"]<img class="wp-image-38372 size-half-width" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/tumblr_l5qat8925d1qbnrqd-300x178.jpg" alt="PHOTO CREDIT: ALLTHINGSNUCLEAR.ORG" width="300" height="178" /> The SBU School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences has gained approval from the Suffolk County government to conduct research on the cooling systems used at Millstone Nuclear Facility in Connecticut, pictured above. The research is aimed at protecting the rising water temperatures of the Long Island Sound. <em>PHOTO CREDIT: ALLTHINGSNUCLEAR.ORG</em>[/caption]

The Suffolk County government approved <a href="http://sbstatesman.com/2015/03/08/suffolk-county-legislator-reaches-out-to-somas-to-save-the-sound/" target="_blank">Legislator Jay Schneiderman’s proposal</a> for Stony Brook University's School of Atmospheric and Marine Sciences to conduct research on the cooling systems used at Millstone Nuclear Facility in Connecticut.

On March 24, the legislature approved the funding of nearly $80,000 by 11 out of 16 votes.

Millstone Power Plant, the largest nuclear facility in New England, is located in Waterford, Connecticut, just miles away from Long Island's coast. It came to Schneiderman's (I-Montauk) attention that the Long Island Sound experienced a major change in temperature in recent years. The rising water temperatures caused cold-water fish species like Atlantic herring, winter flounder and lobster to migrate elsewhere and according to Schneiderman, this could affect a billion dollar industry.

Some legislators see the research SoMAS will be conducting as necessary to keep the environment in tip top condition, like Sarah Anker (D-Mount Sinai).

“I am very much in support of Legislator Jay Schneiderman’s resolution to provide funding for Stony Brook to research water temperature fluctuations near the Millstone Power Plant,” Anker said in an email. “We must do everything in our power to protect our environment which in turn affects our health and the well being of future generations.”

Legislator Monica Martinez (D-Brentwood) also voted in favor of this research. “I believe the study is of great importance,” Martinez said in an email. “It is our fiduciary responsibility to protect the residents of Suffolk County and if we can be at the forefront of ensuring our waters are protected from pollution arising from neighboring areas, then we are a step ahead.”

Other legislators saw the study as a waste of funds. Schneiderman said some county representatives expressed concern the funding for this study will take away the resources for other water quality control projects.

According to Schneiderman’s research, the nuclear reactors used at Millstone give off 15 million Btus, or British thermal units, of heat each hour, which could be the culprit for the changing ecosystem.

Associate Dean of SoMAS Larry Swanson said it is not yet determined when the study will begin. Schneiderman said the study should take approximately four months and finish by September, in time for the expiration of Millstone’s Clean Water Act permit. If renewed, the plant will be granted another five years with its license.

The Clean Water Act states, “Waste treatment management plans and practices shall provide for the application of the best practicable waste treatment technology before any discharge into receiving waters, including reclaiming and recycling of water, and confined disposal of pollutants so they will not migrate to cause water or other environmental pollution and shall provide for consideration of advanced waste treatment techniques.”

According to Schneiderman’s findings, Millstone uses a method of cooling known as the “once-through” method. This process pumps two billion gallons of water through the plant each day to discard excess heat that comes with producing electricity for nearly half the homes in Connecticut. The nuclear coolers would be the best and most expensive device available, which could cost Millstone billions of dollars.

The plant has been fully compliant with providing necessary research to the school about the issues at hand, according to Millstone spokesman Ken Holt.]]></content:encoded>

Browse the tweets of athletes, professional or collegiate, and you will likely stumble across the phrase “no days off." While most athletes boast of never taking a day off, Stony Brook women’s lacrosse freshman Kylie Ohlmiller has long refused to take a minute off, let alone 24 hours.
<p dir="ltr">“I'm a big fan of being busy. I didn't like having any time off, I would just get too bored with myself,” Ohlmiller said in a sit-down prior to SBU’s 7-5 win over Albany. “I've never been a fan of sitting around and not having anything to do. Sports have always been my pastime. I would make all of my friends through sports. All my friends are athletes. It's always been that way my whole life.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The five-foot-three-inch attacker’s dedication has seen tremendous returns, with the Seawolves now 11-0 on the season and Ohlmiller leading the squad in assists and third on the team in goals. Her play has not only resulted in an undefeated record, but also individual successes in the form of four consecutive America East Rookie of the Week awards, four consecutive ECAC Rookie of the Week awards and two Rookie of the Week honors from ILWomen.com.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It's been insane,” Ohlmiller said. “Coming in I had a lot of high expectations for this time, but definitely didn't expect us to be [undefeated.] It's definitely a great feeling. Never been that before.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Along the way, Ohlmiller has not shrunk in the team’s biggest contests. Ohlmiller scored three goals and had three assists in a win over Notre Dame and scored five goals and dealt an assist in Stony Brook’s stunner at Florida.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I know coach had a lot of expectations for me that were of this level so I guess I've just been trying to live up to that,” Ohlmiller said. “I definitely want to keep making an impact in the big games. Be someone the team can go to, someone they can trust in those big games.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">It was those expectations and the trust Head Coach Joe Spallina had in Ohlmiller that got the West Islip native to sign with Stony Brook.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Originally when I started looking at colleges, I wanted to get away from my parents, be on my own,” Ohlmiller said. “But once I started looking and Spallina was that interested in me, he showed me all the potential in this team which is clearly coming true this season. I love being close to home now. My parents can come to all the games. I can go home for a <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_816644259"><span class="aQJ">Sunday</span></span> night dinner and still be back in time for class <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_816644260"><span class="aQJ">on Monday</span></span>.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">When Ohlmiller says all the games, she means all the games.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Every game. They love it. Even the away ones. They take off work, they come to all the away games,” Ohlmiller said. “The game day text from my parents, those are always the best. My dad thinks he's funny. He likes to use his slang sometimes. ‘Rip twine,’ that's his little slang word.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">It was Ohlmiller’s parents that got her into athletics early on and continually supported her through the revolving door of sports she tried.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Both my parents are athletes. They started me off young with soccer and swimming,” Ohlmiller said. “Ever since I was little, instead of having trainers I would go out and play in the backyard with my dad. My sister's been a big part of that too.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Soccer and swimming are only a fraction of the spectrum. Ohlmiller captained her high school volleyball, basketball and lacrosse teams in her senior year. She also surfs from time to time. This plethora of sports experience has helped Ohlmiller develop into the lacrosse phenom she is today.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Volleyball's a big team sport so I learned when other players around you get down on themselves, how to pick them back up,” Ohlmiller said. “A lot of my lacrosse I.Q. comes from basketball. The way the offense is played, there's a lot of similarities.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite her lifelong connection to sport, Ohlmiller has also devoted time to excelling in her academics. Ohlmiller was a two-time Academic All-American and was a member of the National Honor Society and Foreign Language Honor Society in high school.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It was a lot easier in high school,” Ohlmiller said. “It's very difficult here because in high school you only had two hours of practice after school everyday, so you could go home and do your homework. Now you never know how long the practices are going to be, or how hard, or how mentally exhausting. Sometimes you don't want to do your homework after that. Just have to bury my head and keep it going.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ohlmiller has not slouched on keeping up in the classroom since coming to Stony Brook, as she is pursuing a health science degree on top of dissecting defenses on the turf.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I definitely want to work with athletes,” Ohlmiller said. “I am big on learning about the human body, that's my biggest interest. I can see myself being an athletic trainer of some sport or maybe even a PA.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Until then, Ohlmiller will likely continue to dazzle on the field with an arsenal of scoring means that make defenders’ heads spin. She has already made highlight reels with a couple of gorgeous behind-the-back goals. To her, though, these shots are merely routine.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It's kind of just natural now,” Ohlmiller said. “Once you keep doing it it's just like anything else.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although her scoring acumen sticks out, Ohlmiller leads the team in assists.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“In high school it was different because I had to do a lot for the team. It was me and my sister basically and that required me to go to the rack a lot.” Ohlmiller said. “Here there are so many goal scorers that are always cutting hard to the net. When I have the ball, it's impossible not to find them.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">This has been a testament to how well Ohlmiller has meshed with her team, a chemistry that has translated to the Seawolves' overall record. It is safe to say that Ohlmiller has earned herself a day off, not that her mind is anywhere close to thinking the same thing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I can see myself being a leader on this team eventually,” Ohlmiller said. “Hopefully we’ll stay undefeated.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

On Saturday afternoon, the Stony Brook men’s lacrosse team battled back from an early deficit to defeat the No. 12 Princeton Tigers in a 13-10 thriller.

“[It was] a classic college lacrosse game between two great academic institutions. I was very, very proud of my team,” Head Coach Jim Nagle said.

The Seawolves got off to a slow start, letting up four goals in the first quarter while only scoring one.

Princeton’s star midfielder Kip Orban, who will play in the MLL in Charlotte next year and leads all midfielders in the nation in goals per game, set an aggressive tone early, burying two shots in the first quarter. Orban would go on to have five goals on the day, two of which were unassisted.

“He’s just a great player, he really is. He’s big, he’s strong, he shoots the ball with two hands and he can get a shot off quickly. I think a lot of times you see with these big shooters, they take a long time to get rid of the ball,” Nagle said.

The Seawolves' sole first-quarter goal came at the hands of freshman midfielder Matt Robison. This was Robison’s first goal in a Stony Brook uniform.

“He played like a senior today,” Nagle said.

Stony Brook bounced back quickly, as junior attack Brody Eastwood scored directly after a Jay Lindsay-faceoff win and a dish from sophomore midfielder Jeff Reh to kick off the second quarter.

“We weren’t possessing the ball like we should have and were always throwing it away and making very long possessions for the [defense]. But I thought we really picked it up after that first quarter,” Eastwood said.

Eastwood would prove to be the leading scorer of the game for the Seawolves with five goals. This puts Eastwood at the 40-goal mark on the season for the second straight year.

“My teammates were finding me great. I can’t do anything without my teammates,” Eastwood said.

By halftime, Stony Brook held a 7-6 lead, as sophomore midfielder Alex Corpolongo, sophomore midfielder Ryan Bitzer and junior midfielder Chris Hughes all found the back of the net.

Hughes would end the game with five points—two goals and three assists.

At the 5:39 mark in the second, Princeton’s Austin deButts was penalized 30 seconds for an illegal procedure. From there, the Tigers would be a man down three more times for a total of 2:30 minutes. This opened things up for the Seawolves, who capitalized on three of their four man-up opportunities.

“We do a lot of work on man-up and we take a lot of pride in our man-up. I think today it really showed,” Hughes said.

Princeton would tie the game at eight via a 8:37 third quarter goal by Orban, but after a senior midfielder Mike Rooney goal off of a junior midfielder Challen Rogers assist with 7:33 remaining in the third, Stony Brook would hold on to the lead for the remainder of the contest.

The Seawolves scored six times in the last two quarters, with the likes of Eastwood, Hughes, Rooney and junior attack Matt Schultz tallying goals.

But the win can largely be attested to exceptional goal play by freshman Brandon Maciejewski, who showed remarkable composure down the stretch, especially for a freshman, as he notched four saves in the fourth quarter and eight total on the day. Maciejewski played the full 60 minutes in goal.

“The kids so calm all the time, never gets raddled. He played great for us today,” Hughes said about his teammate.

“He had ice water in his veins,” Nagle said.

With this win, Stony Brook, which currently sits at the 29<span style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20px;">th</span> spot in Division I rankings, has a legitimate chance of propelling itself into the top twenty.

“The polls don’t really play into what we do. We’re just focused on being the best team we can be,” Nagle said.

Stony Brook looks to transfer its surging momentum into a conference matchup against UMass Lowell when the Seawolves head to Massachusetts on Friday, April 10.

Tempers flared, legs were slashed and goals were scarce. Such is life when Stony Brook and Albany clash in women’s lacrosse, and Saturday evening’s tilt at Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium was no different.

When the dust settled, the at-home Seawolves reigned victorious, claiming a 7-5 win against their fellow nationally-ranked America East rival.

“Playing Albany is always the most intense game of our season. It’s our rivalry game,” sophomore attack Courtney Murphy said after the game. “It’s a huge game for us, potentially the conference championship game, so we knew we had to get the win.”

Murphy was the game’s leading scorer, finding twine three times in the game. Her 37 goals on the season are good for second-most in the conference.

“We prepared for the game, we knew what to do, we executed,” Murphy continued. “That helped us and we were able to score when we could and I was just able to finish.”

Kylie Ohlmiller, Amber Kupres, Dorrien Van Dyke and Michelle Rubino all scored a goal for the Seawolves, who advance their perfect record to 11-0. Stony Brook and the perennial-powerhouse Maryland Terrapins are the only teams in the country that remain undefeated.

Perhaps the most intriguing matchup in the game was the Great Danes offense against the Seawolves defense. Albany came into the game with the second-ranked offense in the country (17.9 goals per game) and Stony Brook entered play with the second-ranked defense in the country (4.7 goals per game).

The dominance of the SBU defense prevailed, as Albany was held to a season-low eight shot attempts. The stifling defense was even more obvious in the first half, during which Stony Brook held Albany scoreless after the Great Danes attempted a measly two shots. Coach Joe Spallina’s team entered the dressing room at halftime with a 4-0 advantage on the scoreboard.

Stony Brook’s margin at the half could have been even greater had it not been for Albany goalkeeper Courtney Henderson.

“[She] made some key saves at key times when a goal may have ended the game,” Spallina noted. Henderson had five first half saves to keep the score manageable for the Great Danes.

The second half was an entirely different entity. Albany came out strong, firing two shots past Stony Brook goalie Kaitlyn Leahy, reducing the deficit to 4-2 with 19:19 remaining in the game.

Albany may have been much more successful in its comeback efforts had it not been for the strong draw play of the Seawolves. Stony Brook led in draw controls 10-4 in the game and 6-3 in the second half.

With Stony Brook doing a good job of keeping possession in the second half, frustration grew from the Albany side, as the Great Danes increased their defensive intensity. The Great Danes given six yellow cards and a green card in the game. At one point in the second half, Stony Brook was playing with a three-man advantage.

“I think tonight, Albany, they kind of lost their composure. They started swinging. I know they had seven or eight cards, but I’ll be honest with you, I think they could have had three or four more. They were swinging for the fences,” Spallina said of his opponents’ physicality.

“I told our kids, you know, we’ll play however you want to play, but funnel your emotions in a positive way, with poise. I think we did a good job with that.”

The Seawolves’ next game is on the road against the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays on Tuesday at 6 p.m.. Johns Hopkins is known for its prolific lacrosse programs, boasting nine national championships in the sport.

“I told the kids before that we’re going down to the Mecca of lacrosse. Their home field is like the holy shrine of lacrosse and that’s a huge game,” Spallina said with a chuckle.

The game against Johns Hopkins is the second game of a key four-game stretch that Spallina believes will define the season.

“I looked at today as the start of an important  four game stretch for us. We’re 1-0 through that and now we have Johns Hopkins, and Vermont, who beat us last year, then we finish next Sunday at home in what I’m sure will be a very well attended game against one of the top teams in the country Northwestern.”]]></content:encoded>

The Stony Brook softball team won two of its first three America East games this weekend against the Binghamton Bearcats. The Seawolves took the first two games by scores of 15-0 and 3-0, but fell to the Bearcats 13-7 in the series finale.

SBU got an early start in the opening contest, plating five runners on just one hit and three Binghamton errors in the bottom of the first inning. Diane Caruso drove in two of the five runs.

The scoring continued in the bottom of the third inning when Lexie Shue hit a two-run home run to increase the gap to 7-0.

The rest of the damage came in the fourth inning. Caruso hit her fourth homer of the season, a three-run shot to left-center field. Three batters later, Patty Borges smacked a two-run single to right, advancing to second on the play. This brought the score to 12-0.

But Stony Brook was not done. Senior outfielder Shayla Giosia hit a two-out three-run home run, the second of the inning. The 15-0 deficit was the nail in the coffin for the opener of the Saturday doubleheader.

Jane Sallen started game one in the circle for SBU. The junior pitched masterfully, giving up only three hits in five innings of work. This was her seventh win and her third shutout of the season.

The Bearcats’ offense was shut down in the second game of the series as the Seawolves put together a 3-0 victory. Stony Brook scored early as Chelsea Evans drew a bases-loaded walk from Binghamton pitcher Sarah Miller in the first inning, giving the Seawolves a 1-0 lead.

The score would stagnate at 1-0 until the bottom of the fifth, when home run machine Bria Green hit her conference-leading 10th homer of the season, a two-run line drive to left field.

“This was a big opening weekend for us in the America East, and it’s really important for our goals that we make the most of our opportunities, and I thought we did that today,” Head Coach Megan Bryant said of her team’s performance.

Senior Allison Cukrov got the nod for game two, striking out a season-high 10 batters, walking four and giving up five hits in seven dominant innings. She escaped from two bases-loaded, one-out jams without giving up a single run in the fourth and sixth innings.

“I trusted that they would field the ball behind me and everything, so just to kind of put the ball in play and let my defense take care of it,” Cukrov said of her strategy with the bases loaded.

The Bearcat offense came to life in game three of the series as the Seawolves were defeated 13-7.

Down 4-0 after a Green three-run homer and a Giosia-RBI single, Binghamton’s Sydney Harbaugh and Taylor Chaffee each hit two-run homers to tie the game in the third.

The Seawolves quickly answered with another run in the bottom of the inning to take a 5-4 lead.

The onslaught continued in the fourth and fifth innings, as Binghamton scored five and three runs, respectively. Stony Brook answered with two runs in the bottom of the fifth, but after six innings, they were down 13-7.

Sallen started the game but was replaced by Cukrov in the third inning. Sallen returned to the game after Cukrov put in 1.2 innings of work. The pitchers combined for seven innings pitched, 13 runs, 18 hits, six walks and three strikeouts.

The Bearcats used a combination of Shelby Donhauser and Sarah Miller in the circle. They allowed seven runs on six hits with six walks and four strikeouts.

The Seawolves will travel to Fairfield, Connecticut to take on Sacred Heart this Tuesday in a doubleheader. The games start at 3 p.m. and 5 p.m..]]></content:encoded>

The Undergraduate Student Government just announced rock band Panic! at the Disco will be one of two major performers at this year’s Brookfest.

In an article published last year by <i>The Statesman</i>, USG’s Vice President of Communications and Public Relations Danny Chung said bands are more expensive to bring to campus, but after several weeks of speaking with Panic! at the Disco’s management, USG booked the highly-requested band to perform this year after the two parties agreed on a price.

While Chung was unaware of the exact cost, he said the Student Government offered the rock group up to $70,000.

The band was suggested last semester as a possible act for Back to the Brook, and although Panic! was unable to perform then, USG’s early efforts to bring the band to Stony Brook made booking it for Brookfest 2015 easy.

“There was a general consensus among the [board members who choose the artists] that [Panic! at the Disco] would be an artist that students are interested in since they had very good feedback on the polls,” Chung said. “So we just pursued them since we already were in talks with their management. We got that figured out within [early to mid February].”

Panic! is just one of the performers for Brookfest 2015. USG will release additional concert information in the days to come.]]></content:encoded>

Junior Johnny Caputo extended his hitting streak to nine games with base hits in the 11th inning of game one and the second inning of game two, and the Seawolves used clutch pitching efforts to sweep a doubleheader from the Maine Black Bears in America East baseball action on Friday afternoon.

After Tyler Honahan allowed three runs in five innings in the first game, a stifling bullpen effort from Chad Lee, Ryley MacEachern and Teddy Rodliff held the Black Bears to only two runs over the final eight innings of the game in an 8-5 extra-inning victory.

After Maine came back to tie the game in the bottom of the 12th inning, Toby Handley roped a single to center, scoring Bobby Honeyman and giving the Seawolves a 6-5 lead. Insurance runs were added in the next at-bat courtesy of Jack Parenty, who sent a double to right, scoring Cole Peragine and Handley.

Handley finished the afternoon 6-for-11 in the two games, scoring three runs and driving in a pair of them himself.

Stony Brook took the lead in the 12th when Handley laced a triple to right and then scored on a fielder’s choice, but could not hold on, as a Brett Chappell-RBI double tied the game in the bottom half of the inning.

The Black Bears jumped out on Honahan 3-0 after three innings, and eventually chased him from the mound after the fifth inning. He allowed eight hits and only struck out four batters after striking out 13 in his last start against UMass Lowell.

The Seawolves fell behind twice by three runs at 3-0 and 4-1, but finally pulled even in the eighth after Caputo’s bases-loaded sacrifice bunt scored Handley from third.

Matt Senk’s resilient squad came from behind once again in the nightcap, this time only from one run down, to secure a 3-1 victory and the sweep.

After starter Kevin Kernan allowed an early first-inning run, he would not allow a Black Bear runner to reach past second base in his final three innings of work. He also only allowed two more hits the rest of the way.

Stony Brook got its three runs on base hits in the second, fourth and seventh inning. Robert Chavarria scored two of those on singles in the second and fourth by Caputo and Malcolm Nachmanoff, respectively.

Handley scored Peragine with an RBI triple to add to the already sufficient offensive support for Kernan and closer Cameron Stone.

Stone came on in the fifth and recorded the final nine outs of the game, eight of which came via strikeout in his first appearance since March 17, as he continues to recover from injury. He is sure making it look like he did not lose too much of his America East Rookie of the Year form from last year.

The pitching has been helped by outstanding defense, as the Seawolves rank 34th in the country with a 0.975 fielding percentage, nine points behind national leader San Diego.

Stony Brook will be back in action tomorrow afternoon when they travel to New Rochelle, New York to take on Iona. Then on Wednesday at 3:30 p.m., SBU will host Manhattan.]]></content:encoded>

Streetlight Manifesto is back and set to perform on 4/20. This is fantastic news for many students—myself included—who were left disjointed following the blunt cancellation of the punk band's January concert. The Undergraduate Student Government is certainly doing a fantastic job sweetening the pot for us undergraduates, who, if we include <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1547833088828362/">Brookfest’15</a>, now get to attend two concerts with our buds. I have not seen any posters around campus yet, but perhaps they are still rolled tight, stashed away by USG from prying eyes.

Yes, here at Stony Brook, April 20 is such a major part of our campus calendar—some would call it the month's high point. It is around this time when leaves return to the trees and the grass becomes green once more. But this day being a big deal makes sense at such a science-focused school; after all, April 20 is a historic day in aeronautics. In 1983, engines of the Russian space shuttle Soyuz T-8 were set ablaze, billowing smoke as the spacemen steered the craft toward the Salyut-7 Satellite.

The significance of USG scheduling the Streetlight Manifesto concert on 4/20 goes beyond just the scientific history of the date, as 4/20 is right in the middle of midterm season for undergraduates. These students will want to escape the stress and pressure of exams, which often make them feel chronically tired. A dope concert is just what these exhausted students will need to chill out and relax. Thanks to USG scheduling this event on 4/20, many students may get extraordinarily high scores on their exams.

These reasons notwithstanding, there are many others that would explain why USG chose 4/20 for this concert: It could light up hype for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1547833088828362/">Brookfest'15</a>, which is just four days later. Though only <a href="http://sbstatesman.com/2015/04/06/brookfest-2015-act-announced-panic-at-the-disco-will-rock-sbu/">the headline act has been announced</a>, the concert may help any undergraduate students who feel burned that the other performers are still a mystery.

Regardless of the reasons why the concert is scheduled on 4/20, the fact remains the event is looking to be a total blowout—if enough people show up to its venue (SAC Ballroom A), they’ll be positively baking in the heat.

Streetlight Manifesto's return to Stony Brook, in spite of the first cancellation, still has students pumped up for the concert. One look at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/871848936209026/">the event’s Facebook page</a> shows excitement for the band is as bright and lively as ever, and that even after 3 months, it has not dimmed a bit.

Floating high above all else, one thing is certain: with all this excitement and the special date, the 4/20 concert has Stony Brook students fired up. If it lives up to expectations, it will be a night to remember. The memories of a great concert with great friends will stay with the attendees for a long, long time.

At least the ones who aren’t stoned as all hell.]]></content:encoded>

MOOCs and the Democratic Republic of Congo were the highlights of the USG Senate meeting on Thursday, April 2 regarding Stony Brook’s expansion plans for online learning and a student effort for a SUNY product reformation, respectively.

Wendy Tang, the associate provost for Online Education, spoke to the senate to gather student opinions about online learning and explain what the university wants to do with it in the future.

“If you asked anyone five or six years ago, online education didn’t have a good reputation,” Tang said. Now, it “is a tool to be used efficiently and intelligently to address issues we are facing in public universities with large classes,” she said.

Sen. Nathan Blazon-Brown brought up one such issue involving teachers’ ignorance of or resistance to adapt to new technology for learning in the classroom.

“If there was a way to help, or ironically enough, educate teachers on technology, because I feel like that education already is there, but some teachers refuse to use it,” Blazon-Brown said. “I mean I have professors that don’t even know how to use the projector.”

Tang said she and the Division of Information Technology’s Teaching, Learning + Technology (TLT) branch are working with teachers to put together workshops so that teaching habits can better connect with new students’ learning habits.

“It’s a subtle culture change, and for that I need your help, in a sense that if you guys have a good experience, or even a bad one, please let the faculty know,” she said.

Massive Open Online Courses, which can accommodate thousands of students in large, low-cost learning, and “flipped” classrooms, where most of the learning is done at home while more work experiential learning is done in the classrooms, are two things the school will be exploring in the future, Tang said.

Jake Littman, a senior psychology major and leader of the Conflict-Free Campus Initiative of SBU, brought to the floor his “Resolution for SUNY Undergraduate Student Government to support procurement policy reformation towards the reformation of verifiably conflict-free products.”

Littman began by outlining the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and explaining that armed groups that have numerous human rights violations use conflict minerals like tin and gold to fund their illegal actions.

“We want to take funding away from armed groups perpetuating violence,” Littman said.

He pointed out that $5 million per semester is collected from students from a technology fee, and some of that money goes towards companies like Canon and Nikon, who are not as selective when it comes to using conflict minerals.

Littman’s resolution states that “it is our duty to see to it that all efforts are being made to ensure that technologies purchased for our campuses and beyond are contributing to peace and stability rather than the funding of armed groups perpetuating the crisis in the DRC.”

After it was approved 18-0-0, Littman said he would be willing to “drive up to Binghamton myself and bring it before the floor of the SUNY Assembly.” The SUNY Student Assembly holds conferences during which student leaders from each of the 64 SUNY campuses come together and voice their opinions, plans or problems.

The Commuter Student Association Agency Act also passed by a vote of 16-0-1. Senator Taylor Bouraad said “CSA would be an agency instead of a club,” and no immediate changes would go into effect. In the long term, CSA President Vincent Justiniano hopes it can have more of a structure like USG, with aspects like an executive board.

“My personal feeling is that we’ve grown and we can’t grow any further,” Justiniano said. “This will give us potential to grow and expand in different ways.”

Also on the agenda for the night was the 2015 USG Constitution Act,  which was tabled at the request of Vice President of Academic Affairs Steven Adelson after he received no feedback regarding the possible changes and revisions to the USG Constitution. The vote was postponed until next meeting.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Closing NYC schools for Muslim holidays creates tension between religious groups</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_38365" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-38365 size-full-width" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/US_NEWS_CALIF-RAMADAN_5_SA-600x403.jpg" alt="SACRAMENTO BEE / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE" width="600" height="403" /> In a major move last month, Mayor de Blasio announced New York City will begin to close its schools in observance of the two major Muslim holidays. Here at Stony Brook University, the school is not closed for any religious holiday. "This is the way it should be. There is no reason for church and state to mix; it just creates an environment of contempt and rivalry between religious groups." <em>SACRAMENTO BEE / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE</em>[/caption]

In <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/04/us/new-york-muslim-school-holidays/">early March</a>, Mayor Bill de Blasio made New York City the first big city in the United States to close its schools in observance two Muslim holidays, following suit of several smaller towns across the country.

The two days happen to be the most important and meaningful in the faith. Muslim leaders in NYC have been <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/05/nyregion/new-york-to-add-two-muslim-holy-days-to-public-school-calendar.html?_r=0">lobbying for this legislation</a> for years and their hard work has finally paid off. This is a great win for Muslims<strong> </strong>in New York. In a city that already recognizes many Jewish and Christian holidays, this marks a stride toward fairness. Three of the world’s, and New York’s, most popular religions are finally accounted for and recognized.

Here is where the trouble lies. If the city is trying to be fair, why would its politicians stop here? There are hundreds of religions in the world. What is to stop the next most popular religious group in the city to advocate for their holidays to be recognized?

Carmen Farina, the City school Chancellor, said “this new addition will also enable a teachable moment in the classroom for our students to learn about religious tolerance and the societal contributions of various cultures." While it is true that this step is a huge step forward for religious and cross cultural awareness, Farina, whether she intends to or not, is making it apparent that there are only three religions that matter to the New York City Department of Education. This is a problem.

Say what you want about Stony Brook University, but when it comes to dealing with diversity, our university does it right. Stony Brook, <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/sb/calendarmessage2.html">according to study done in 2009</a>, is more than a quarter Catholic and more than a tenth Jewish and Muslim. Still, the school does not cancel classes on any major holidays (with the exception of those holidays that fall during breaks). This is the way it should be. There is no reason for church and state to mix; it just creates an environment of contempt and rivalry between religious groups.

You might say SBU is disrespecting religions by not observing important holidays. Stony Brook's website <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/sb/calendarmessage2.html">says</a><b>,</b> “we have always believed that religious observance is and must always be a personal choice, not an institutional mandate” and “if we were to cancel classes for all of these religious holidays, it would be impossible to preserve our academic mission.” This may seem like a lack of respect toward those observing their religion, but in reality, the university is showing its deep-rooted dedication to education. It is the only way to keep everyone on the same playing field.

Stony Brook, despite its strong stance on holidays, does not by any means discourage religious involvement. There is Mass on campus every weekend, <em>s</em><em>alat</em> on Fridays, Kosher and Halal foods offered every day and Holi celebrations annually. The school supports these occurrences and embraces the beauty of its diversity.

While NYC politicians have made an extremely powerful statement by passing the legislation to close schools for Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, paving the way for religious understanding and tolerance throughout the city, those politicians have further marginalized people of the faiths that the city does not recognize and have set a bad precedent that will culminate when the city is faced with a controversial challenge: What justification does NYC have to say yes to Islam, Christianity and Judaism, but no to another faith?

The simple answer is that there is none.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Virtual distance: Life through the screen</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_36450" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-36450 size-full-width" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/DSC_2775-600x400.jpg" alt="MEGAN MILLER / THE STATESMAN" width="600" height="400" /> Karen Sobel-Lojeski, a professor in Stony Brook University's Department of Technology and Society, developed the concept of "virtual distance," which occurs when one watches a live event occurring through a screen. She says it creates a "psychological sense of detachment" from reality, which could prevent one from acting in an emergency situation. <em>MEGAN MILLER / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

Early last month, 15-year-old Ariana Taylor was beaten by four other girls at a McDonald’s in Flatbush while at least a dozen people looked on. Approximately three minutes of <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/girl-beaten-mcdonald-caught-video-warning-graphic-article-1.2145599" target="_blank">video</a> were captured, showing the teen getting punched and kicked in the head repeatedly during the incident on March 9.

“Yo, she’s dead,” cried one of the onlookers. “It’s a murder!”

A couple of days after the incident, <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/story/bystander-mentality-teenagers/" target="_blank">The Brian Lehrer Show on WNYC</a> had Karen Sobel-Lojeski, a professor in Stony Brook’s Department of Technology and Society, on the show to talk about virtual distance.

The concept is Sobel-Lojeski’s brainchild, and she describes it as “putting a screen before what is happening and what we’re seeing,” which in turn creates a “psychological sense of detachment.”

Besides the infamous bystander effect, which psychologytoday.com defines as being “when the presence of others hinders an individual from intervening in an emergency situation,” Sobel-Lojeski said virtual distance could make matters worse, as seen in the case at McDonald’s.

“Kids are not only affected by the bystander effect, but matters are made worse once they put a screen in front of their face to tape it,” she said. “What’s actually happening seems surreal.”

In an <a href="http://theconversation.com/virtual-distance-technology-is-rewriting-the-rulebook-for-human-interaction-38693">article</a> recently co-authored by Sobel-Lojeski for theconversation.com called “Virtual distance: technology is rewriting the handbook for human interaction,” she explains virtual distance does lead to lower tendencies to help neighbors in trouble.

“When the ripple effects of actions and inactions seem to go no further than the screen, empathy and collaborative skills can be difficult to develop,” she wrote. “For example, children seem to have trouble looking into other people’s eyes and are less able to hold conversations.”

Joseph Whearty, a sophomore majoring in business management and cinema and cultural studies, expressed his observation that virtual distance is widespread with millennials and recognized the pros and cons of technology.

“It can be beneficial because it allows everyone to be connected and experience things that they were not able to see,” Whearty said. “I think a detriment, though, is it creates more of a distance between the bystander and the event because now they might see themselves as documentarians, who have no obligation to interact, rather than bystanders.”

Debankur Chatterjee, a sophomore computer science major at Hunter College, went to school at Brooklyn Technical High School and said another factor might have played a big part in the non-intervention of the crowd.

“I’ve had some black friends in Brooklyn and I noticed some had mistrust in authorities,” Chatterjee said. “So that probably played a part in why nobody called the police.”

Sobel-Lojeski also stressed that another major byproduct of virtual distance is the tendency for people to extend their identity into the online world.

According to <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/victim-brooklyn-mcdonald-attack-brags-fame-online-article-1.2146897">The New York Daily News</a>, Taylor posted “Everyone Like Im Famous Now” to her Facebook page after the beating video was gaining popularity online.

“People get in their own head and think getting on social media makes you the center of the world,” Sobel-Lojeski said.

But Sobel-Lojeski not only diagnoses the problems of virtual distance. She has a goal of making sure people—especially millennials—understand the difference between a life with human experience and a life mediated with technology.

She said the “threshold generation,” the last demographic to know a life without such immediate technology and a life fully immersed in it, has a “moral responsibility” to help people understand the differences.

“It’s my mission in life,” she said. “I’m not advocating throwing technology out the window, I'm advocating identifying the problem.”

Sobel-Lojeski said a place will never be found where only the good side of technology exists, but virtual distance can be managed.]]></content:encoded>

All good things must come to an end. This is true of the Stony Brook women's lacrosse team’s 11-game win streak to start its season, before the No. 9/7 Seawolves fell to No. 20/20 Johns Hopkins on the road, 7-5.

Sophomore Courtney Murphy scored her 100th career goal with 24:32 remaining in the second half on a pass from classmate Dorrien Van Dyke, becoming the eighth player in program history to hit the mark.

It was more than just a personal achievement, as Murphy’s shot leveled a tense game against a nationally-ranked opponent after the Blue Jays got a goal of their own to pull ahead just 16 seconds into the second half.

Both teams had 13 shots in the game and the Seawolves had a 9-8 advantage in shots on the cage, but it was more so a battle of attrition. Neither team pushed the pace, with a lot of time spent passing the ball around the exterior of the offense.

As the game went along, there was a sense that the first squad that could gain a multi-goal advantage late in the contest would be able to hold on.

To the dismay of Head Coach Joe Spallina’s team, it was Johns Hopkins that would do just that. The Seawolves grabbed the lead for a moment on Van Dyke’s 23rd goal of the year, but the Blue Jays went on a three-goal run to take a lead that they would never give up.

Though the Seawolves had a couple of chances in the last ten minutes, Johns Hopkins would hold the ball for much of the time left in the contest, running out the clock for arguably the Blue Jay's biggest win of the year.

In the first half, junior Taylor Ranftle showed why she has been a nice addition to Stony Brook’s lineup after transferring from Virginia, digging the Seawolves’ teeth into the game by tying affairs after the team fell behind early. Neither team would score until nearly twenty minutes later, when the Blue Jays scored their third goal courtesy of sophomore Haley Schweizer.

The lead would not last long, as Murphy inched closer to her landmark goal, netting her 99th just 1:38 before halftime.

For the first time this season, less than five players scored goals for Stony Brook. Also, the Seawolves only had one assist, coming from Van Dyke, showing a recent trend of the team lacking the fluidity that they have come to be known for.

Although the Seawolves suffered their first loss, much is to be said about Spallina's team. The Seawolves' 11 wins to open the season is the longest in program history. In fact, it ties their longest winning streak from last season, a year in which they made it to the second round of the NCAA Tournament.

The Seawolves travel north to Burlington, Vermont to take on their America East rivals, the Vermont Catamounts on Saturday at 11 a.m. They return home to face Northwestern (8-3) the very next day at noon.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Stony Brook softball split a pair of non-conference games held on Tuesday and Wednesday, beating Sacred Heart 12-6 on the road in nine innings before losing at home to St. John's, 9-2.

“The days were definitely different,” SBU Head Coach Megan Bryant said.

Senior Allison Cukrov took the mound on Tuesday for Stony Brook, allowing three runs in four innings of work. Without much offensive support at that point, Stony Brook trailed 3-0.

However, the Seawolves would not go down without a fight. After Stony Brook tied the game in the sixth, the game went into extra innings. In the eighth, Seawolves infielder Patty Borges drove in a run and later stole home to give Stony Brook a 5-3 lead.

Sacred Heart scored two in the bottom of the inning to keep the game alive, but Stony Brook began a decisive hit parade in the top of the ninth. Senior Shayla Giossia drove in what became the game-winning RBI on a double to give Stony Brook a lead they would never lose. Six additional runs would put the game on ice for the Seawolves.

“We were a little bit more disciplined at the plate [in the ninth],” Bryant said. “We didn’t figure that out until later in the game, but fortunately we did.”

The following afternoon ended much differently for the Seawolves. Poor pitching and costly errors contributed to Stony Brook’s eventual demise.

Cukrov took the hill once again as the team struggled immediately out of the gate. After allowing a leadoff single, a routine dropped-popup by shortstop Chelsea Evans put runners on first and second. Following a St. John’s walk, Red Storm infielder Erin Burner ripped a double into the outfield to give St. John’s a 2-0 lead.

Following the hit, St. John’s still had runners on second and third with no one out. Red Storm outfielder Brittany Garcia hit a routine ground ball to third, which Stony Brook mishandled. This cost the Seawolves a run and put St. John’s ahead 3-0.

“Today we should have played better on defense,” Bryant said. “Some days you have good defensive days, some days you don’t and today wasn’t good for us.”

After a scoreless inning by Cukrov, Giossa led off the second with a solo home run to cut the St. John's lead to two.

Despite cutting the deficit, the Seawolves were unable to carry any momentum into the third inning. Cukrov's day was ended after two St. John's home runs put the Red Storm ahead 6-1. This proved to be a decisive blow for Stony Brook, as St. John’s won their eighth-consecutive game.

“St. John’s is a good team with tough pitching,” Bryant said.

The Seawolves do not play again until Saturday, when they begin a decisive three game series against America East rival Hartford.]]></content:encoded>

Second baseman Adam Genners committed two errors in the first two innings for the Manhattan Jaspers and the Stony Brook Seawolves took advantage of this, plating five unearned runs en route to a 10-3 victory in an NCAA non-conference baseball matchup Wednesday afternoon at Joe Nathan Field.

“We’re always talking about taking advantage of any mistakes the other team makes,” manager Matt Senk said. “Clearly that was tough for their guy. But we took advantage of it.”

Robert Chavarria reached on the first error by Genners when he mishandled a grounder, scoring Toby Handley from third base. Chavarria then touched home after Johnny Caputo laced a double past left-fielder Jason Patnick and to the fence, giving Stony Brook a 2-0 lead.

Caputo’s hit streak is now up to double digits at 10 after this double. He also bunted a single past the pitcher in the third inning to make it a multi-hit day.

“His aggressiveness and doing a good job of jumping on his pitch has allowed him to get on this streak,” Senk said. The junior is starting to find his groove, upping his average to .253 on the season.

The second error occurred an inning later, when Handley’s grounder slipped through Genners’ legs, allowing Jeremy Giles to touch the plate. One batter later, Jack Parenty hit a frozen rope to the center field fence, scoring Handley and Andruw Gazzola.

Both errors proved costly, and with an excellent start from Nicholas DiEva, Manhattan found it impossible to get themselves back in it.

The freshman pitcher earned his second win of the season in his second collegiate start, no-hitting the Jaspers after three innings. But, as according to plan, Senk pulled the plug after that.

“We need him for the weekend,” he said.

The numbers speak for themselves for the Cherry Hill, New Jersey native. He has given Senk 17.1 quality innings, striking out 20 batters and only allowing seven earned runs. The defense has not helped him on batted balls, as the run total doubles to 14 when looking at total runs allowed.

Gazzola joined in on the hit parade in the third, lacing a double to the right-field fence, plating Caputo after his bunt single.

This was the first earned run allowed by starter Steve Arntsen, who would only last until the end of the third.

In the fourth, Brendan Bisset hit a soft grounder past the outstretched dive of Giles, plating Joe McClennan from third. Aaron Pinto allowed the run, but would settle down afterwards, getting out of the jam with just the lone score crossing the plate.

Stony Brook would answer with a run in the fifth via a Gazzola RBI fielder’s choice, and then a trio in the sixth to put the game well out of reach for the Jaspers.

This weekend the Seawolves will welcome the UMBC Retrievers to Long Island for a three-game series. Tyler Honahan and Daniel Zamora are the probable starters for the doubleheader on Saturday, but as always, the weather will have to cooperate if the Seawolves want to play their first full three-game set as scheduled this season.

“It would be nice if we could just play the games when they’re scheduled to be played,” Senk said. “I think the guys overall have handled it well.”]]></content:encoded>

This development could potentially lead to the prevention of abnormal cell growth. <em>PHOTO CREDIT: STONYBROOK.EDU</em>[/caption]

Life on the microscopic scale is in continual flux. It may take thousands of years for new species of mammals to form, whereas individual cells are capable of evolving much faster. Whether it is the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria or a cancerous tumor, cellular evolution shapes life at every level. Thanks to one Stony Brook group, scientists are now able to track thousands of cell lineages—complete with evolutions and developments—simultaneously and in high detail.

Published last month in the journal <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v519/n7542/full/nature14279.html">Nature</a>, Sasha Levy and his colleagues developed a DNA barcoding system that enables quantitative monitoring of entire populations of cells. Levy is an assistant professor of physical and quantitative biology at the Louis and Beatrice Laufer Center at Stony Brook University.

“Essentially, barcoding is a way to get a last name into the genome. And that last name is just a random piece of DNA,” Levy said in an interview. “It is sort of a nonsensical name, but what it signifies is a lineage that gets passed from generation to generation. Fission yeast grows asexually so there’s never a mixing of last names.”

Levy and his colleagues developed the barcoding technique in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, commonly known as baker’s yeast—the gold-standard model organism for studying eukaryotic cell growth. The yeast grows while floating in nutrient broth, forming suspended cell cultures.

“With yeast, history happens much faster, because their generation time is 90 minutes,” Levy said. “In the lab we can look at 200 generations and try to understand how those populations evolved and competed—who expanded and who got wiped out.”

Each DNA barcode consists of about 20 random base pairs inserted specifically into each cell’s genome.

For each generation the fission yeast replicates, the barcode is copied faithfully into two identical daughter cells along with the rest of their genome.

“Occasionally there are errors in sequencing, so we wanted to make the names different enough such that if the yeast make a typographic error you won’t confuse the names,” Levy said.

Because yeast has a fixed replication time of 90 minutes, the researchers could allow the yeast colonies to grow a set number of generations. Afterward, genomic DNA was extracted from cells, sequenced with next-generation techniques and quantified using a computer software.

“By looking at the trajectories of the fastest growing colonies we can try to figure out what happened to those colonies, when it happened, and how good was the mutation that made its growth better,” Levy said. “These trajectories increase at a rate that tells us exactly how much better a particular mutation is, since the ones that increase fitness do not follow a typical pattern.”

One of the next steps will be trying to use the yeast barcode system to study protein-protein interactions in living cells.

“With yeast you essentially have the whole protein <a href="http://www.netlibrary.net/articles/interactome" target="_blank">interactome</a> in one tube,” Levy said. “We are working on testing millions of protein interactions simultaneously and asking what is happening in a particular environment.”

Levy said DNA barcoding is not restricted to yeast, but can also be applied to other cell types.

“We think this technology will be useful in seeing how microbes become resistant to antibiotic drugs or how cancers develop into tumors,” he said.

Because cellular evolution is fundamental to life, the ability to trace individual cell lineages with high precision and sensitivity could help shed insight on the mechanisms behind abnormal growth and perhaps offer a way to stop that process in its tracks.]]></content:encoded>

The BFP's goal is to emphasize public awareness and transparency about animal testing in laboratories.  <em>STEPHENS COLLEGE / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE</em>[/caption]

Beagle Freedom Project’s new <a href="http://www.identitycampaign.org/animal_finder">Animal Finder</a> tool allows people to virtually adopt cats and dogs being used in research laboratories around the country, including those at Stony Brook University.

The four Stony Brook University hounds listed by Beagle Freedom Project have all been “adopted” within one week of the new tool's launch. They are only about two years old, according to documents requested from the university by BFP.

According to Jeremy Beckham, BFP's <a href="http://www.identitycampaign.org/">Identity Campaign</a> coordinator, the practices performed on the animals are unknown, but the Animal Finder tool allows people to virtually claim ownership of these animals. Although the virtual adopters cannot take the animals home, Animal Finder gives them the resources to order public records requests for the animals’ veterinary records and daily care logs.

The goal of BFP is to create a new outlook on the use of animal testing by collaborating with supporters regarding the individual dogs and cats. The group is attempting to increase public awareness of what happens in laboratories and increase transparency. BFP became aware of the animals being used at SBU because the school reported their use to the United States Department of Agriculture. this <a href="https://acissearch.aphis.usda.gov/LPASearch/faces/CustomerSearch.jspx">report</a> can be found on the USDA website.

According to Beckham, it is difficult to find information about the experiments. By New York State law, the university, being a public institution, must share this information by responding to public records requests.

“We’ve had more than 600 people choose, which exceeded our wildest expectations to be honest,” Beckham said. “I’ve been overwhelmed with phone calls and emails of people concerned about the animals they pick.”

With the launch of the new animal finder tool, Beckham has assisted people in writing public records requests for their newly adopted animals.

“I’ve been working on this issue for more than a decade and I have never seen a dog or a cat in a laboratory who I would say has a good life,” Beckham said.

“The school has no affiliation or involvement with the Beagle Freedom Project (BFP),” said Greg Filiano, a spokesman for the university, in an email. “Any listing of dogs ‘adopted’ from Stony Brook University on the BFP website is not the result of communications between Stony Brook and the BFP, nor is the information based on any official data on Stony Brook research animals.”

In response to the new tool, SBU said it is adhering to its own policies regarding this issue.

“Stony Brook University’s Division of Laboratory Animal Resources (DLAR) complies with all regulations and humane practices regarding animal laboratory research,” Filiano said in an email. “DLAR has an established process for reporting any animal welfare concerns through the University’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).”

Beckham said he hopes that the Animal Finder tool will shed some light on Stony Brook University.

"And we hope that we can also give these dogs an identity instead of an identification number,” Beckham said.]]></content:encoded>

On April 2, 2015, 147 students at Garissa University College in Garissa, Kenya were massacred by members of the Islamic terrorist group Al-Shabaab. As reports of the brutal killings flooded in through global networks, prime-time American news outlets were deafeningly silent.

In fact, I did not know of the massacre until I <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/03/world/africa/garissa-university-college-shooting-in-kenya.html?ref=todayspaper">read an article</a> about it in The New York Times.

Many people had expected the slaughter to be plastered over every news network in America, much like the executions of the French writers at the office of the satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo, on Jan. 7, 2015. Many people took to social media sites complaining of the lack of coverage of the Kenyan massacre, comparing it with the seemingly unrelenting coverage of the Charlie Hebdo attacks. However, I feel the main reasons behind this seemingly-unfazed attitude towards this particular massacre are the increased frequency of Islamic terror attacks in that region of the world coupled with a lack of cultural connection between the average American and Kenya.

I will start off by explaining the latter. Americans seem to have a cultural-dissociation with the rest of the world. This is not necessarily a bad thing and is most likely due to a history of isolationist policies by the U.S. government as well as a general inability to draw connections to people halfway around the world. But in the case of the Garissa and Charlie Hebdo massacres, it is far easier for us as Americans to identify with Paris than it is for us to identify with Garissa.

I would argue it does not have to do with race. Rather, I would argue that as Americans, France has constantly been in the forefront of our cultural consciousness. How many of us would like to visit France someday? Or how many of our favorite movies take place in France? Hell, we are taught about the history between France and America as soon as we can read. By contrast, few if any Americans have Kenya in their cultural consciousness, let alone be able to identify Kenya on a map. We, as a people, have no real history with Kenya, and the distance between us and Kenya both physically and culturally makes it difficult for us to identify with those in other parts of the world.

I think another reason for this indifference by the news networks can be blamed by the sheer number of terrorist acts committed in that general region of the world, as in Africa and the Middle East. Every few days, be it on the BBC’s website or a small portion of the daily news, I am informed of yet another massacre committed by Islamic extremists in a part of the world most of us know nothing about, committed by groups whose name we cannot pronounce, against people we will never know. By contrast, the Charlie Hebdo massacre was performed in a part of the world most of us can envision, against people some of us knew, trying to destroy ideals central to the American identity.

Please do not think this article is in any way a justification of the silence by news networks of this massacre. I stand with those in Garissa. Not only do I stand with them, but I mourn for them. They were just like you and me—college students, trying to better themselves through education. Like myself, they were Christians, and many were executed for their faith and their refusal to renounce it.

But most importantly, they were more than a number. They were not just 147 people. They were brothers and daughters, sisters and sons. They were students and friends, husbands and wives. They were doctors and lawyers, teachers and engineers. They were Christians and Muslims, Kenyans and Africans. Most importantly, they were human beings, just like you and me.

It is a true tragedy that these young men and women had their lives taken from them in such an abrupt and terrifying matter. I pray that their families can come together in this time of mourning and overcome the loss of their children, and that the souls of all those who lost their lives may rest in peace.]]></content:encoded>

(above) and the band Twenty One Pilots will also be performing at Brookfest 2015 this year, alongside Panic! At the Disco. B.o.B. was only 17-years-old when he signed his first major-label record deal, according to Billboard.com. <em>PHOTO CREDIT: MARK GUIM</em>[/caption]

The Undergraduate Student Government has now announced the other acts that will be performing at the Brookfest 2015: B.o.B. and Twenty One Pilots.

Even before this announcement, student comments were mixed regarding Brookfest after USG announced that Panic! at the Disco would be performing, with some saying the band was a flashback to middle school.

B.o.B first broke into the music world in 2006 with his mixtape "Cloud 9." Hailing from outside Atlanta, the rapper, known to some as Bobby Ray, has been nominated for six Grammy awards.

B.o.B has also worked with Haley Williams of Paramore on the song "Airplanes" and Bruno Mars on "Nothin' on You."

B.o.B has performed at other schools, like the University of Houston and Indiana University.

Twenty One Pilots is a two-piece band from Ohio. The band's sound is a mix between indie pop and pop-rap. Twenty One Pilots' first album, also named "Twenty One Pilots," was independently released in 2009. The group's next album, "Regional at Best," was released in 2011, followed by "Vessel" in 2013. The band plans to release an album on May 19 of this year called "Blurryface."

The group also has some experience playing at a university. When the group had its "Quiet is Violent" tour in 2014,  it stopped at Iowa State University to play for the students there.

Vice President of Communications for USG Danny Chung said that the decision regarding the artists was partly influenced by the students who attended the Student Activity Board meetings.

Chung said that USG felt Twenty One Pilots would be a good act to transition between the other two because the group is a mix of the other two artists' music styles.

Now that all of the artists have been released, the countdown to Brookfest is on. Brookfest will take place on Friday, April 24 at 7 p.m. at the Island Federal Credit Union Arena.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>College Gal Cooking: Bacon, egg and cheese pizza</title>

Nearly 31 million Americans skip breakfast, one of the most important meals of the day, according to <a href="http://www.abesmarket.com/blog/food-2/31-million-americans-skip-breakfast/" target="_blank">Abe's Market’s</a> website. Breakfast not only helps recharge your brain, but it also energizes the body.

So in celebration of all things breakfast, this week’s College Gal Cooking recipe combines one of the most important meals of the day with one of the most popular foods: bacon, egg and cheese pizza.

<strong>Ingredients:</strong>

<em>Fresh pizza dough</em>
<em>Mozzarella cheese</em>
<em>Romano or Parmesan cheese</em>
<em>1 tomato</em>
<em>Bacon or turkey bacon</em>
<em>4 eggs </em>

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit.

Take the dough out of the packaging and sprinkle some flour on it so it is easier to roll. To take the dough out without it sticking to your hands, spray your hands with cooking grease or use olive oil or butter. The added flour will also prevent the dough from sticking to your hands or the dough roller.

Although the dough does not need to be rolled before placing it onto the pan, rolling the dough beforehand makes it easier to spread evenly on the pan.

Once the dough is spread evenly on the pan, add your desired amount of mozzarella cheese. I like to put a little extra so all of the ingredients melt together.

Then, slice and dice the tomato and sprinkle the pieces onto the top of the pizza. If you want to add some flavor to your pizza, cook some strips of bacon. Do not cook the bacon too crispy, as the pizza must go into the oven for the ingredients to cook together.

After the bacon cooks, take the strips and chop them into small pieces. Sprinkle the bacon bits evenly onto the pizza.

Now, take the eggs and crack them over the pizza. Be careful when doing this, as the eggs could run off the pizza.

Once the pizza is ready, place the pie in the oven for 10 to 15 minutes.  If you like a softer crust, leave the pie in for 10 to 12 minutes. For crunchy crust, leave the pizza in the oven for up to 15 minutes. Keep a close eye on it to make sure the dough does not burn.

Once the pizza is done, you can add Romano or Parmesan cheese. Then, cut a slice and take a bite.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_38616" align="alignleft" width="300"]<img class="wp-image-38616 size-half-width" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/150412_WLAX-vs-Northwestern_Manju.Shivacharan_1566-1-300x450.jpg" alt="MANJU SHIVACHARAN / THE STATESMAN " width="300" height="450" /> Sophomore Dorrien Van Dyke added two goals in Stony Brook's first victory over a top five team, defeating Northwestern 11-9 Sunday afternoon at Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium. <em>MANJU SHIVACHARAN / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The last time that seven-time National Champion Northwestern played in Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium, the team won the NCAA Women’s Lacrosse Tournament. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stony Brook reminded them whose house it is, shocking the Wildcats for their first win over a top-five team in program history by the score of 11-9. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Head Coach Joe Spallina could not contain his excitement, touting his team’s performance before even taking a seat after the game.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Stepped it up. Never about talent, it’s all about our grit, Spallina said. “Landmark win. Landmark win. It’s monumental.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Never been more proud of a bunch of kids.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Grit can be defined as courage, resolve and strength of character. The Seawolves showed all of that and more in front of nearly a 1,000-fan crowd putting it on full display.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Just yesterday, senior captain Michelle Rubino could not play against Vermont due to a lower body injury. Though still affected, there was no way she would give up the chance to help her team in such a big moment. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Watching her score a goal and dish four assists, it would be hard to tell that she was even hurt at all.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“[She] came into my office this morning, said there’s no way I’m staying off the field so how are we going to make this work,” Spallina said. “That kid has the heart of a lion.” He made her the equivalent of an attacker<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>though still compared to her usual all-over-the-place midfielder spot, </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Spallina has said all season long and throughout his time at Stony Brook, the Seawolves are not necessarily about the flashy plays or the brand recognition. It is the heart and soul they put on the field every day that represent who they are.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“She’s honestly, if you had one player [to say] what are we about, that’s it,” Spallina said. “That’s a special kid man.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rubino’s early spurt helped reassure the Wildcats that they were not going to roll into Long Island and stroll out with a win.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I think when we came out 5-0 and punched them in the mouth they were a little stunned,” sophomore Dorrien Van Dyke said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It helped to have the team’s leading goal scorer, sophomore Courtney Murphy, do what she has done throughout her career put the ball in the back of the net. She scored three times, but it was the grit, as her coach spoke about, that shined through in the most critical of times.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“She’s just a tough kid. She’s going to pull her sleeves off and get after it,” Spallina said of Murphy, who controlled three draws, a department that smells of wanting it more. “[She is a] big gamer, she likes the big stage, all our kids do.” For a program that plays in the America East, playing a so-called “legendary” program in any sport is a huge moment in itself. To beat them means far more.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I think this is really a huge step for us to show that we’re not just a one hit wonder,” Murphy said. “We didn’t just beat Florida. We’re here to stay.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Spallina took more time to put his thoughts into words in describing exactly how big of an accomplishment beating this team is, being that they are consistently in the semifinals.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“For us to beat Northwestern, a team that’s won multiple national championships in our place in that stadium,” Spallina said. “Really, every one of our girls grew up watching them win national championships so we were playing more than them, we were playing the brand, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Freshman sensation Kylie Ohlmiller continued to come up big for the Seawolves, scoring three of her four goals to start the second half for Stony Brook, just when it seemed that Northwestern may ride their momentum-shifting end to the first half into the next frame. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I thought we battled better in the second half with the draw controls, even the ones we didn’t get we were in a position to get, and that was big,” Spallina said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sophomore Dorrien Van Dyke scored twice and classmate Kristin Yevoli put the exclamation point on the win, scoring her only goal with 3:10 to go to put it out of reach.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ohlmiller, who less than a year ago was duking it out with high school teams full of players, put it best. “They were definitely a team that you would grow up desiring to be on that team,” she said. “That was the goal—to go to Northwestern. Now that we’re one of them, that’s sick.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mike Rooney continued his red-hot senior season by tying Stony Brook’s Division I points record for a year with 77, but it was not enough to finish an impressive comeback against Lehigh, which beat the Seawolves, 12-11, on Sunday afternoon.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“It was a hard fought game, I was proud of the way our team fought back,” Head Coach Jim Nagle said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I didn’t think we played particularly fundamentally but we showed heart in coming back and we didn’t get the breaks we needed.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rooney did all he can, scoring three goals on the day, one with only seconds remaining in the third quarter to give momentum to the Seawolves by tying the game at 9. However, tying the school’s record at this level would not
be enough.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I’m really not even thinking about that,” Rooney, who firmly remains in third in the country for points per game, said. “I’m just pretty mad that we lost today.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Junior defenseman Lucas Rock would not let his team give up without a fight, as he scored only the second goal of his career, his first this season, with 1:25 remaining.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Kind of just brought the ball up on the clear, they were locking off everyone,” Rock said. “There was not a lot of time left, so I was just going to the goal seeing what was going to happen, luckily it went in.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Seawolves would wind up with possession and a chance to finish off the comeback victory, but a late turnover sealed their fate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We went from a big win to kind of a tough loss. We went through a period where we just kept winning good games and we were on a hot streak,” Rock said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I think this loss kind of brought us down a little bit and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>[we are] ready to get back to working and get back to what we do best.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is fair to say that despite fighting back time and time again in the second half, Stony Brook did not perform how they wanted to from the get-go. The Mountain Hawks punched the Seawolves in the chin with a five-goal second quarter, giving them a 7-3 lead heading into the break.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I think at the beginning of the game we came out pretty slow,” Rooney said. “We didn’t really stick to our fundamentals.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A good sign for Stony Brook was having nine different players score goals. Three of those student-athletes, Rock and sophomores Jay Lindsay and Mark Ellis, all scored for the first time this season.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We kind of push transitions sometimes so it was good for them to get goals and stuff,” Rooney said. “When some people aren’t stepping up, other guys will on our team.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Behind a career performance from Brody Eastwood, Stony Brook delivered an absolute shellacking on the road Friday night at the hands of the UMass Lowell River Hawks, winning 20-9.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Eastwood eclipsed the River Hawks goal total single-handedly, potting 10 goals on the evening. The third-year Canadian’s 10 goals ties a school record previously achieved in 2008 by Jordan McBride. Eastwood now has 50 goals on the season, leading the team.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mike Rooney had a game-high six assists to go along with a pair of goals. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By helping on his 44th goal of the year, Rooney has set the school record for assists in a season, a particularly impressive feat achieved with four games remaining in the regular season.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Seawolves will have to move on quickly, as defending National Champion Duke will greet Stony Brook at Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium at 7 p.m. on April 15.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em>Skyler Gilbert contributed to this story.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stony Brook softball swept the Hartford Hawks in a three-game set on Saturday and Sunday. The Seawolves won all three games by scores of 16-3, 8-0 and 12-0, respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Seawolves started the series with a five-inning 16-3 victory over the Hawks. Senior outfielder Bria Green had yet another big game in what is going to become routine, going 2-for-3 with a home run and five RBIs. Jane Sallen got her ninth win of the season, pitching all five innings and allowing only four hits. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Stony Brook offense came to life in the top of the second, as it plated seven batters. Green hit her first home run of the game, a three-run shot over the left field wall, and Lauren Kamachi and Diane Caruso each hit RBI doubles to add to the early damage.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The fourth inning was troublesome again for the Hawks, as the Seawolves put up nine runs. The scoring started with an RBI single<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>off the bat of Chelsea Evans, plating Allie Pisciotta. Green then smacked a two-run shot, her second of the game and thirteenth of the season. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Three Hartford pitchers combined for five innings pitched allowing 14 hits, while walking three batters and striking out none.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stony Brook continued to dominate Hartford as they batted their way to an 8-0 victory in five innings later that day. Lexie Shue went 1-for-3 with three RBIs and senior ace Allison Cukrov had another dominant outing, throwing five innings while allowing just two hits and striking out nine. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She picked up her fifth win of the season in the second game of the doubleheader.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The blowout began in the top of the second inning. With the bases loaded and one out, Shue blasted a bases-clearing triple to give Stony Brook a 3-0 lead. She then scored on a wild pitch. Shayla Giosia knocked in the fifth run of the inning with a single, sending Green to the plate. Hartford hit its only two hits of the game in the bottom of the second inning. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stony Brook scored another run in the third and two more in the fourth to take an 8-0 lead.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Two pitchers for the Hawks combined to give up eight runs on 10 hits, three walks and one strikeout over five innings.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Seawolves closed out the sweep in a 12-0 blowout on Sunday. Sallen got the nod to start once again and pitched with complete control, allowing only a single hit over six innings of work. She also walked one batter and struck out two.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The bats went to work early as SBU plated five runs in the top of the first inning on four hits. Green hit her third home run of the series, a three run blast to center field. Stony Brook tallied on a run in the second and the fifth to bring the score to 7-0.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Seawolves scored their final five runs in the sixth inning. After some small ball to make the score 9-0, Kamachi hit a three-run shot to make the score 12-0, her first homer of the season. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Their conference lead now stands at one game over UMBC.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_38949" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-38949" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/4.28.13_bingsoftball_nina.lin-24-of-28-600x4001-600x400.jpg" alt="STATESMAN STOCK PHOTO" width="600" height="400" /> Senior Bria Green (No. 13, above) has posted a .421 batting average, a .505 on-base percentage and a .961 slugging percentage. The outfielder's"personal goals are just to do everything [she] can to help [the team] win a championship." <em>STATESMAN STOCK PHOTO</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Besides the ability to hit towering home runs or make diving catches, a star player is someone who leads her teammates while sacrificing everything she has to win.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stony Brook’s softball team is still overcoming a heartbreaking defeat from the 2014 season after coming within an out of a NCAA tournament birth. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With only four returning seniors on this season’s squad, outfielder Bria Green has risen from the bunch to lead the team as star of
the Seawolves. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“My personal goals are just to do everything I can to help us win a championship,” Green said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So far this season, Green is doing everything and more. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She leads the team in almost every offensive category so far over Stony Brook softball’s 13-12 record to start the 2015 campaign. </span>Firing on all cylinders, Green has posted an unreal slash line of a .421 batting average, .505 on-base percentage and .961 slugging percentage.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No. 1 on the team with 32 hits, 11 home runs and 30 runs batted in, Green garners the respect of her teammates and instills in them the confidence that she can lead the Seawolves to the tournament. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I try to lead by example. It’s easy to be vocal and say what other people need to do when you’re doing what you need to do as well,” Green said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Green’s passion for victory landed her talents at Stony Brook. Despite shining as a rookie in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference, Green departed Delaware State after her freshman year. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I did research on Stony Brook and their program. I wanted to be at a school that was going to compete, softball wise,” Green said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since suiting up in red and white, Green has made an impression on the Stony Brook community. Her outstanding play on the diamond landed her on the second-team All-America East team in both her sophomore and junior seasons as a Seawolf. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A Long Island native, Green was raised in Wheatley Heights, New York. She was an athlete since her youth, playing softball, basketball and volleyball before molding into a premier softball player. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I was the best at softball,” Green said. “I wasn’t that good at volleyball and basketball,” she laughingly added.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Her athleticism was passed down from her parents, Arthur Green and Michelle ChinQuee. Green's father</span> is a former collegiate basketball player at St. John’s University, while her mother ran track at the University of Maryland.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although she looks to her family for support, Green notes a past friend as her biggest source of inspiration. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“When I was a sophomore in high school, one of my best friend’s mom passed away. There have been times when I was younger that I wanted to quit softball and she told me to keep going. She told me that I was a great athlete and that I’d have a great career. I do play for her,” Green said. “I play for every single one of my teammates, my family members and God.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Despite the 2014 season’s unfilled ending, Green is poised to leave the heartbreaking loss in the past and be the star of a winning Seawolves softball program.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I just don’t give up. I’m quite resilient. I don’t let my failures hold me back,” Green said. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_38953" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-38953 size-full-width" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Fernandes_BU_Pichardo_web1-600x452.jpg" alt="STATESMAN STOCK PHOTO" width="600" height="452" /> This past January, former Stony Brook soccer star, Leo Fernandes, right, signed a one-year loan contract with the New York Cosmos from the Philadelphia Union. While a Seawolf, Fernandes became the program's all-time leader in points and earned the America East Midfielder of the Year award three times. <em>STATESMAN STOCK PHOTO</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This weekend former Stony Brook soccer star Leo Fernandes will be suiting up as a member of the home team for the first time at Hofstra University’s James M. Shuart Stadium. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not to worry Seawolves fans, Fernandes will not be wearing the uniform of the rival Pride. </span>He instead will be making his home debut as a member of the New York Cosmos.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This past January, Fernandes signed a one-year loan contract with the Cosmos, a team in the North American Soccer League that plays home games on the campus of Hofstra University. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The NASL is a second division-league of the United States soccer league system which contains three-divisions. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After getting two valuable years of experience as a member of Major League Soccer’s Philadelphia Union, Fernandes looks to keep his pro career moving in a positive direction in the 2015 season with New York</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I thought it would be a great opportunity for myself to get games in. I’m still young in my career, and I think I can help out the Cosmos a lot this year,” Fernandes said just prior to his first game with New York. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“[My personal goal] is to try and get better every day and try to impact the game as much as I can to help the team win.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The 23-year-old midfielder did not wait long to make a positive impact with his new team. </span>In the Cosmos’ spring season opener against Fort Lauderdale on April 4, Fernandes scored the game’s lone goal.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">His score on a header from just outside the six-yard box in the 58th minute would be all his team would need to secure an opening night victory. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Scoring big goals is nothing new for Fernandes, who came up large time and time again while playing for the Seawolves. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During his four seasons with the Stony Brook soccer team, he became the program’s all-time leader in points and took home the America East Midfielder of the Year award three times.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Those were amazing times,” Fernandes said when asked about his collegiate playing days. “We had a great team, and I had two great coaches. I thought the four years were really good, and I learned a lot at Stony Brook.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During Fernandes’ senior season, during which he led the Seawolves with nine goals and seven assists in 18 matches played, he was selected in the fourth round of the 2013 MLS Supplemental Draft by the Union.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“It was an unforgettable experience,” Fernandes said. “Just to get drafted is a huge accomplishment. And when you get drafted it’s not a guarantee you make the team. So when I went into the preseason the focus was to perform every day in practice, and luckily I was able to get a contract out of it. So that was a very positive experience.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After bring drafted, Fernandes briefly played for the Harrisburg City Islanders of the United Soccer League on a loan. </span>But Fernandes quickly found his way back to Philadelphia, making his first MLS start on July 3, 2013.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once he earned a regular spot on Philadelphia’s roster, Fernandes had to adjust to the grueling schedule that comes with participating at a professional level.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“It’s very tough, because the college season is only three months, and then you play the pro season, which is 10 months,” he said. </span>“But, I thought I adjusted pretty well. It was a good rookie year for myself, and I was happy with the way it went.”</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fernandes’ playing time was limited during his rookie season, as he appeared in just seven games and logged only 281 minutes. </span>But in his sophomore campaign, Fernandes saw a major increase in time on the field, as he appeared in 13 games, started seven and logged 697 minutes.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He also notched his first three career points, finishing the year with two goals and an assist. </span>The assist took place in the Union’s home opener last season, and stands out as one of Fernandes’ most memorable moments so far as a pro.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I got an unexpected start, and we happened to win the game 1-0,” he said. </span>“I had the assist to win the game, so that was definitely my favorite moment.”</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fernandes hopes to create more memorable moments this season with the Cosmos, as he makes his return to Long Island. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With his new team slated to play four times at Hofstra during the NASL spring season, the North Babylon native will give his family and friends a much easier commute for when they come and watch him play.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“My family drove to Philly to come watch all the home games, so they should definitely be at every game now,” the midfielder said about playing here. “I’m happy that I can play in front of my friends and family again, which is gonna be really nice.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The 23-year-old will make his return to Long Island on Saturday night when the Cosmos host Tampa Bay. </span>The match with the Rowdies is set to begin at 7 p.m.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After months of practicing for hours on end, the African Student Union finally showcased its work on Friday, April 10, on the neon runway in the SAC Auditorium.

The show this year, titled "Moulin Rouge,” was showcased to a full house. Once the show began, the burlesque theme was supplemented with a voice telling the tale of a young girl trying to make it as a dancer.

While many of the attendees were expecting a lingerie scene—or the “sex scene,” as many addressed it—the fashion portion of the show showcased clothing of African influence, as evident by the patterns. Both male and female models had complete awareness of their roles and their walk and showcased confidence, elegance and playfulness, depending on the collection they were modeling.

The show was an inclusive one, with the participation and attendance of students and alumni from a wide range of backgrounds.

See the gallery below of ASU’s 15<span style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20px;">th</span> annual fashion show:

		<title>Campus briefing: SAB to get $40K raise in USG 2015-2016 budget proposal</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_38629" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-38629 size-full-width" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/150409_untitled_Manju.Shivacharan_1427-600x400.jpg" alt="MANJU SHIVACHARAN / THE STATESMAN " width="600" height="400" /> Senator Nathan Blazon-Brown, above, started a discussion about Brookfest after proposing to increase SAB funding. The budget for SAB was increased to $650,000, with the overall 2015-2016 USG budget totaling nearly $3.2 million. <em>MANJU SHIVACHARAN / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After nearly four hours of discussion, delegation and debate, the 2015-2016 Undergraduate Student Government budget of nearly $3.2 million passed on Thursday, April 9 and increased the budget for the Student Activities Board to $650,000.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SAB’s original funding remained unchanged on the budget proposal at $610,000. College of Arts and Sciences Senator Nathan Blazon-Brown motioned to increase SAB by $100,000, which failed by a vote of 8-10 and began a debate of quality over quantity regarding Brookfest musical acts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Finally, a motion to allocate $40,000 was proposed and failed initially, but was later reconsidered and passed by a vote of 13-6.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">College of Engineering and Applied Sciences Senator John Mele said the increases must have directions before more money is pumped in.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I think a number with a purpose would be more useful, and it doesn’t necessarily have to be $100,000, it could be somewhere around $35,000 for smaller events,” Mele said. “I don’t know if it’s necessary to have more talent.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Proxy Senator Oscar Icochea explained the difficulty of using SAB funds to book contemporary, popular acts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“To put things in perspective, Kendrick Lamar, before he dropped an album, was in a package with Steve Aoki for around $60,000,” Icochea said. “After he got big, and generated a lot of airplay, his price went to around $300,000 for one show. So in the perspective of talent, to get someone who generates a lot of airplay now, the cost would be astronomically high.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">About 20 clubs and organizations have been allocated $0.00 on next year’s proposed budget for various reasons. One such group was WUSB, which came to the meeting to plead its case.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“WUSB is not a club,” Mary Garvey, the radio station’s treasurer, said. “It’s an organization, it’s a service, it’s a historian society that has been here for 39 years. We fundraise more so than any other club because we match our fundraising with the budget you give us, which we failed to obtain this </span>year because I had a death in <span style="line-height: 1.5;">the family.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">USG Treasurer Kathryn Michaud explained during the meeting that while WUSB will technically have no budget next year if the current proposal passes, there are still ways the radio station and other clubs can regain their budgets. </span>She added that although WUSB did not submit a budget application despite being made aware of the deadline in advance, it would not be fair to other clubs to make exceptions after the deadline.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I do want to clarify you are not being shut down and you are still eligible to get a budget,” Michaud said.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Clubs that applied for budgets but were cut by 50 percent or more will have the opportunity to regain funding through fall revisions. In the case of clubs that did not apply for budgets and were cut by 50 percent or more, only 50 percent of the amount they were cut by can be regained.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Whoever is the next USG Treasurer will be sending out emails over the summer, collecting applications, and will be working with the new budget committee to distribute those funds,” Michaud added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I just wanted to say, this happens every year, and we’ve never cut WUSB before, so we should just give them their money and move onto the next club,” Vice President of Student Life Kenneth Myers said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Two early motions to reallocate all of WUSB’s funds back failed and a final motion to approve 50 percent of the group's budget failed 7-11.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Stony Brook Sailing Club, which made a comeback after breaking apart in the early ‘80s, received a increase in funding of about $2,000. However, the team treasurer Avi Mayerhoff explained the team’s situation to the senate.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“With this increase, while it is very much appreciated, we’re going to have to cut our club tremendously,” Mayerhoff said. “We would either have to lose our host yacht club, or possibly lose our coach.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">An original motion to add $10,000 to the club’s budget failed 7-11, but a subsequent motion to add $5,000 passed by a vote of 13-5.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As for the budget process as a whole, Michaud said USG changed it up a little bit from what was done in previous years.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“This year what we had as our main objective was to make sure that every club was able to have enough funding to function, provided that they followed the correct policies and procedures,” Michaud said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She said the first step in creating the new budget was to cut out everything that clubs did not necessarily need to function, and then proceeded from there with budget allocation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“When you really get down to the core purpose of this organization, it’s to spend money, it’s not to save money,” Myers said. “It’s to spend money in a way to make student life here on campus better.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><em><strong>Correction: April 14, 2015</strong></em></p>
<p class="p2"><em>A previous version of this story stated that Oscar Icochea is the SAB representative. He does not hold this title. </em></p>
<p class="p2"><em>A previous version of this article also stated that all clubs that were cut by 50 percent or more can only regain 50 percent of their cut budget through fall revisions. The article has been corrected to reflect the different policies for clubs that applied for regular budgets and clubs that did not apply whatsoever when it comes to fall revisions. </em></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Family, friends, faculty and colleagues celebrated the dedication and naming ceremony of the Sidney Gelber Auditorium on Thursday, April 9 in the Student Activities Center. Approximately 60 guests celebrated the memory of Gelber, who passed away in November 2014. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gelber was SBU’s first provost, the first dean of the College of Arts and Sciences from 1968 to 1971, the second academic vice president from 1971 to 1981 and a professor of philosophy. He not only wrote “Politics and Public Higher Education in New York State,” a book on the history of Stony Brook University, but also paved the way for Stony Brook’s initial accreditation by Middle States.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">James McKenna, former deputy to the academic vice president and provost and associate professor emeritus of the Department of Technology and Society, also called this distinguished man “the wisest, most intelligent, most committed, and most effective university administrator I have ever met.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gelber’s colleague Donald Ihde spoke about his friend’s contributions to philosophy. A distinguished professor of philosophy, Ihde noted that Gelber’s second daughter Alexis was a student in one of Ihde’s classes and described the whole family as “highly intellectual.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">William Arens, program director and Study Abroad Tanzania Professor in the Department of Anthropology, recounted how he applied for promotion as a professor of philosophy. He applied twice, but both times he was rejected. However, Gelber stepped in and supported him. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Leonard Mell fondly described how Gelber called him a “Socratic Gadfly” on the first day they met, thereby forming a friendship between the two of them, and how Gelber would often start their discussions with a joke.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mell advocated for an annual two-day symposium on the issue of War, Peace and Development in our times to “continue Dr. Gelber’s concerns…in Socratic and Humanist manner, while helping to reinforce a vital aspect of the University’s mission to help assure a continuation of our democracy and a bright future for our students.” This seminar would potentially take place in this newly named auditorium. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">McKenna elaborated upon Gelber’s tenacity in troubling times and personality. As provost, Gelber dealt with police raids, “rambunctious faculty,” and administration in Albany that doubted whether it wanted a university centered at Stony Brook. Around 1969, classes were cancelled for three days in which Gelber and his colleagues talked and “solved all the problems of Stony Brook” in the gymnasium. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">McKenna recalled Gelber’s final words at the end of the meeting: “Feel good, feel good.” Gelber genuinely meant them and “most people did feel good, whether they got what they were coming to ask for or not,” McKenna said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ceremony concluded with the presentation of a plaque dedicated to Gelber.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I would like to imagine that with the events that will be taking place in this auditorium, somehow those words ‘Feel good, feel good,’ will resonate with all the participants,” McKenna said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

The Stony Brook community came together on Tuesday, April 7 and Thursday, April 9 during “Part of the Pack,” a two-part suicide awareness and prevention program sponsored by the Residence Hall Association and the National Residence Hall Honorary program aimed to unite Stony Brook students as a community to talk about the stigma of suicide and depression on college campuses so students could gain a better understanding of mental disorders and how to obtain help for them.
<p class="p1">According to a study by Emory University, more than 1,000 students commit suicide on college campuses per year. Suicide is the third-leading cause of death of people aged 15-24, the age of most undergraduates, and the second-leading cause of death of people aged 25-34, the age of most graduate students.</p>
<p class="p1">Though this is the first year the event has been held at Stony Brook, the executive board members of RHA and NRHH are hoping to make the event an annual one.</p>
<p class="p1">“The whole idea of this event is that this is the beginning,” Sunjum Dhariwal, the RHA senior vice president, said. “We want to take the shame out of the word suicide and that, as students, we can do a lot to change this. So let’s start it now. Let’s start a conversation today.”</p>
<p class="p1">Part one of the program was scheduled to start in the SAC where students would light candles and take a walk down the academic Mall. However, due to the rain, the event was moved to Ammann Lounge in Mendelsohn Quad.</p>
<p class="p1">Inside the lounge, there were tables set up, filled with “Part of the Pack” buttons and candles for students to take. A large, yellow poster was set up for students to write their pledges for helping others. Some wrote advice about saying “hi” to a stranger each day, others wrote positive encouragement about looking for the bright side and never being scared to ask for help.</p>
<p class="p1">Representatives from Stony Brook’s Counseling and Psychological Services attended on both days reach out to students.</p>
<p class="p1">“We are trying to enhance our involvement with campus residents and to do more programs out the center,” Julian Pessier, the interim director of CAPS, said. “We want to make aware as much as possible that we are a place to go.”</p>
<p class="p2">Part two of the program was a talk held in the Hendrix Lounge in Roth Quad. The environment of the discussion was very relaxed; there were sandwiches and snacks on tables by the windows <span style="line-height: 1.5;">and all the couches in the lounge were turned towards </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">each other in a circle.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Pessier started off the conversation by passing out a handout with ways to recognize signs of people who may be struggling, resources on campus and pointers about how being self-aware and recognizing that it is “OK to not be OK.”</p>
<p class="p2">“So much can be done for people before they have those [suicidal] thoughts, and that’s to notice the signs of it,” Judy Esposito, interim associate director of CAPS, said. “Knowing these signs could be the difference between knowing if somebody is having a bad day or if somebody is struggling.”</p>
<p class="p2">Around 20 students attended the talk event, and a large part of the discussion went to asking CAPS various questions from how to get a friend to come in for help to what students should do if they felt unsatisfied with CAPS.</p>
<p class="p2">Esposito said that CAPS tries to help as many students as they can, but because mental health is so unique for each person, it is hard to find a perfect solution for each student. She also said that students do so much by bringing in people that they know are struggling.</p>
<p class="p2">Students at the talk spoke about how admitting they had a problem in the first place, whether is was depression, anxiety or stress, was one of the hardest things to do.</p>
<p class="p2">“I’ve been going to therapy for 10 years now and it was the scariest thing of my life,” said Dom DiMatteo, a business and economics major at Suffolk Community College. “Especially since I was such a proud egotistical person, it was that much harder, but it was also the best decision I ever made.”</p>
<p class="p2">RHA and NRHH plan to grow the event for next year. Until then, they said they hope that the students who did attend the event this year will take what they learned to help other students and break the stigma on mental health.</p>
<p class="p2">“Alexander the Great did not build an empire by himself,” DiMatteo said. “Sometimes you have to use people to make yourself the best that you can be.”</p>

Gurevitch plans to apply meta-analysis to genomic data in the future.   PHOTO CREDIT: STONYBROOK.EDU[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dr. Jessica Gurevitch, professor of ecology at Stony Brook University, is revolutionizing the field of ecology through her large-scale studies of invasive species and use of meta-analysis to synthesize findings in the field.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gurevitch’s work focuses on understanding the spread of invasive species and characterizing their predicted rate of increase. She </span><span class="s1">explained that most non-native species do not become a problem—only a few become serious invaders. </span>As a result, most scientists have studied invasive species only after they become serious invaders and therefore, know very little about the early stages of biological invasions.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gurevitch aims to study the spread of invasive plants from the early stages on a large spatial scale to better understand the process. </span>Her work focuses on spotted knapweed, a plant species that has been a problem in western America, but only recently appears to be spreading on the east coast.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“It’s becoming more and more of a problem in the eastern U.S.,” Gurevitch said. “We have a really good chance to follow this plant and see what happens when a plant is in the process of becoming a serious invasive threat.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gurevitch specifically focused on the process behind a plant becoming invasive. She and her collaborators at Stony Brook and the University of Texas wanted to determine if all of the different populations scattered across the landscape were behaving in the same way. They hypothesized that many of the populations are not changing or are even declining, while only a few of them are growing rapidly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gurevitch and her team found, measured and tracked a large number of populations of spotted knapweed in eastern Long Island and in the Adirondack Mountains.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“So far, many of the populations either disappear, stay the same, or decline, and only a few of them are exploding and growing rapidly, some increasing by as much as ten times every year,” Gurevitch said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many of the populations that are spreading rapidly are found in the Adirondacks, raising concern because the Adirondacks are a protected region of ecological and recreational importance. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By understanding which populations are growing the fastest, management teams might be able to better allocate resources towards the areas with the most aggressive populations of the species. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another aspect of Gurevitch’s work focuses on applying meta-analysis, or the combining of findings of independent studies to draw conclusions, to ecology.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She said became interested in statistics early in her career. </span>“The kinds of statistics that were easily available may not be suited to answer the kinds of ecological questions we had,” she said. “So I became very interested in developing and modifying those tools with collaborators in order to be able to get strong, clear answers to complex ecological questions.”</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By combining the work of scientists who are attempting to answer the same question, meta-analysis allows for a more powerful conclusion than any of the studies on their own.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gurevitch has worked on various problems in ecological meta-analysis, and is currently working with colleagues on a meta-analysis of latitudinal gradients of species diversity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Her earlier work includes a major study that used meta-analysis to analyze the impact of competition among different kinds of species in nature.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“It had a really big impact in helping our understanding of competition, but also in introducing meta-analysis as a very powerful tool for resolving important questions in the field of ecology,” Gurevitch said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the future, Gurevitch plans to continue expanding the use meta-analysis and aims to work with collaborators to apply meta-analysis to genomic data. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Welcome to Between the Lines. Each week, our spring sports beat writers will take a look at the action on the baseball and softball diamonds, as well as the men’s and women’s lacrosse fields, and put their observations together. This is the first edition of our column.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>Point 1: SBU baseball’s pitching has gone from question mark to strength thanks to the freshmen</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Bryan Tatelman, Brandon McNitt and Frankie Vanderka were all seniors last year. The 2014 America East Freshman of the Year Cameron Stone was injured earlier this season. </span>Stony Brook’s pitching was becoming a question mark entering conference play.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Tim Knesnik was coming off of a rough season, and Daniel Zamora and Ryley MacEachern were both coming off of surgery. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Everything was in shambles, and the only thing holding the pitching together was consistent-starter Tyler Honahan and a bunch of first-year players.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Kevin Kernan is first on the team in ERA of the consistent pitchers, posting a 0.98 mark with a pair of wins in nine outings. </span>Teddy Rodliff is holding together a 1.12 ERA in nine appearances, with both pitchers combining to allow only four runs and striking out 16 batters. Nicholas DiEva has only allowed seven earned runs in 17.1 innings pitched and secured a pair of wins.</p>
<p class="p4">With six returning players from last season and four batters having on-base percentages of over .400, this team has turned from one with an offense that would have to secure every victory, to one that is balanced and determined to make some noise.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">-<i>By Cameron Boon, Assistant Sports Editor</i></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b><i>Point 2: Big bats making big impact for SBU softball</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Stony Brook’s lineup is nothing to sneeze at. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">This season, the Seawolves have a 8-0 record when they score eight or more runs in a game. When they score seven or fewer runs, they have an 8-12 record. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A lot of this high-powered offense has come from the hot bats of senior leaders Bria Green and Shayla Giosia. </span>The two sluggers lead the America East conference in home runs with 14 and seven, respectively.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Green’s numbers so far this season are incredible. She is batting .439 (good for second in the America East) and slugging a whopping 1.037, the best in the conference. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">She also has the most total bases in the America East with 85. She has an on-base percentage of .520,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>good for fourth in the conference.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Giosia is having a great season of her own. She has a .371 batting average, slugging .719, and getting on base at a .426 pace. </span>The outfielder has racked up 64 total bases as well.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When these two do well, the whole team does well. These numbers speak for themselves. </span>The combination of Green and Giosia could very well be the best pair of hitters in the America East.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Expect big numbers from these two all season long.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">-<i>By Dylan Moore, Staff Writer</i></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b><i>Point 3: SBU men’s lacrosse should be ranked in the top 15</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Men’s lacrosse is heating up. Fast. After a heartbreaking loss to a now 3-7 St. John’s team, in which the Red Storm went on a late 7-0 run, the Seawolves have found their stride. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The team is 9-1 since that game, only falling to Albany, the No. 10 team in the country and reigning America East champs, by two goals. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Along the way, the Seawolves beat an undefeated Marist team on the road, warded off a top-25 Fairfield team and handled No. 12 Princeton. </span>The team now sits at no. 29 in the NCAA Men’s Lacrosse RPI ranking.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The thing that stands out in this Stony Brook team is the unselfishness. Six players on the squad have double-digit goals, while seven have hit the double-digits in the points category.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Another key factor to success has been the emergence of freshman goalkeeper Brandon Macijewski. Macijewski grabbed the starting job after sophomore Hayden Johnstone was hit with injuries. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Macijewski has not looked back since, posting a 5-1 record, 49 saves and a .480 save percentage. He is extremely composed for a freshman and ramps up his game when it is needed most. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">His four fourth-quarter saves in the game against Princeton showed his aptitude to step up in the clutch. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The Seawolves have yet to face their toughest challenge yet, as a ninth ranked and defending NCAA champion Duke team comes to town April 15. Stony Brook will have a chance, once again, to see if they can hang with the big boys. A win here would mean serious consideration for a top-10 spot the following week. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><i>-By Chris Peraino, Staff Writer</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>Point 4: SBU women’s lacrosse has officially established themselves as NCAA title contenders</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">As a top-10 ranked team in the country, the 2015 incarnation of the Stony Brook women’s lacrosse team may be the first team in any sport in school history to be considered a national contender. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">This team has all the tools to make a run at an NCAA championship next month. The old adage goes, “To be a champion, you have to beat a champion,” and that is precisely what the Seawolves did on Sunday against Northwestern, winning 11-9. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The Northwestern Wildcats came into the game ranked No. 5 in the country and have won seven of the last ten NCAA championships in women’s lacrosse.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">With senior leadership from Michelle Rubino and Amber Kupres in the midfield, lockdown defenders in Maegan Meritz and Alyssa Fleming and underclassmen Courtney Murphy and Kylie Ohlmiller sniping shots in the offensive zone, the team does not have a weakness. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If this Seawolves team can maintain their poise and composure come playoff time, they have a legitimate chance at becoming the first NCAA team champion in Stony Brook history.</span></p>

This would eventually lead to a 6-5 victory for the Seawolves. <em>CAMERON BOON / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I knew the game was on the line and I was happy to be in that situation,” senior catcher Cole Peragine said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The situation was simple: runners on second and third, two outs and the UMBC Retrievers held a 5-3 lead in the second game of a double-header. Peragine was the last life the Seawolves had to try and extend the game.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Strike one went by, and I kind of figured off-speed was coming and it was down and in where lefties like it,” Peragine said. </span>He turned on it and laced a base hit to right field, bringing home both runners and tying the game.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Robert Chavarria then provided the icing on the cake in the bottom of the eighth, grounding a single through the left side of the infield and bringing in the winning run and capping the comeback for a 6-5 victory in game two of a three-game series with UMBC.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Early in the year, we were doing a great job of going out there and punching people in the nose right away, but we weren’t doing a great job of counterpunching,” Manager Matt Senk said. “I think the guys, going back to last week’s Maine game, I think we took another step towards that.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was a gut punch that would have reprecussions, as UMBC struggled in the final game of the three-game series on Sunday, losing yet again.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A weekend that UMBC entered one game back and with the same number of losses as the Seawolves saw them drop to 4-7 in America East play and four games back with a month to play in the regular season.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We knew they were going to come in and make a statement,” Senk said. “We clearly feel like we’ve got a good club and want to stay on top [of the America East standings] all the way through.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Game one of the weekend was much less dramatic, courtesy of Stony Brook ace Tyler Honahan. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He dealt 6.2 innings of quality innings, only allowing three Retriever hits and striking out seven batters to increase his total to 41 on the year, good for second on the team. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Seawolves got an early boost in this one, with sophomore Casey Baker blasting his first home run of the season over the right-field wall, scoring Chavarria. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That was all Honahan would need, only allowing four runners reach base with only one getting 90 feet from home. That</span> was on a two-out triple by Vince Corbi in the second inning, but Honahan promptly struck out Jamie Switalski to end the threat. No runner would get past second the rest of the game.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Chavarria drove in what would be his first run of the day in the seventh, reaching on an error by UMBC shortstop Kevin Lachance. This allowed Peragine to score unearned and extend Stony Brook’s lead to 3-0. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A pair of Kevins would take the hill for UMBC in the following inning, but neither would have any success.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kevin Little replaced Retriever starter Joe Vanderplas to start the eighth, and walked the first two batters of the inning.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Enter Kevin Ladner, but the situation would improve about as much as the first name changed. After two Seawolves batters were retired, a pair of walks were issued to Peragine and Toby Handley, the latter bringing in a run.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jack Parenty then provided the big blow, a bases-clearing triple to center field to bring in Peragine, Handley and pinch-runner Billy McLean to make it 7-0 Stony Brook.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Chavarria allowed Parenty to venture the final 90 feet and touch home in the next at-bat, an RBI single up the middle. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In game two, the Seawolves bats were held silent until game two. Four hits through six innings were not getting the job done for Senk’s squad, much to the credit of the Retrievers’ starting pitcher, Conrad Wozniak.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I don’t know if we’ve come across a kid with that kind of pin-point location,” Senk recalled. “That kid could basically put the ball wherever he wanted to.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The key words there was six innings. Game two is seven innings in regulation length, and that is where the Retrievers lost all of their momentum.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After a pair of base hits by Chavarria and Johnny Caputo, Retrievers manager Bob Mumma pulled Wozniak in favor of reliever Denis Mikush. </span>He would not be able to retain the lead.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Andruw Gazolla loaded the bases with a single, and then a wild pitch scored Chavarria and made it a 5-2 Retriever advantage. Bobby Honeyman’s RBI groundout scored Caputo and cut the lead to two at 5-3.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After Jeremy Giles walked and then proceeded to steal second, the stage was set for Peragine. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Every baseball player wants to be that guy in the last inning,” Peragine said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The catcher was that guy, and he delivered the big hit, sending the game into extra innings. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In game three it was yet another dominant pitching performance paving the way for the three-game sweep, this time by sophomore Ryley MacEachern.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He went 6.2 innings, just like Honahan in game one, and delivered similar numbers. He also only allowed three hits, but only put up four in the strikeout column. </span>Nevertheless, it was still more than enough as Stony Brook took the third game of this series, 6-0.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a game that consisted of balanced, spread out scoring, the Seawolves scored in five of the eight innings, only scoring multiple runs in the same frame once.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gazzola had a standout day, going 3-for-4 off of UMBC’s starter Matt Chanin. </span>He also drove in Caputo on a base hit up the middle in the fifth to increase the lead to 4-0.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Chanin only lasted 3.2 innings in the matchup, allowing six Stony Brook hits and three runs. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Four relievers came in for the Retrievers and allowed the same number of runs in 5.1 innings, with Connor Staskey and Mikush holding the Seawolves scoreless in a pair of 0.2 inning relief efforts. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Peragine and Handley each added RBI singles in the second and fourth innings, respectively, and Caputo’s sacrifice fly in the third also brought home a run.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Seawolves added insurance in the eighth with a pair of runs. Giles scored on a wild pitch and Baker grounded out to second, driving in another run to finish the scoring. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The sensational first-year seasons for Kevin Kernan and Teddy Rodliff continued, as they combined for 2.1 innings of scoreless work, only allowing one hit. Kernan’s ERA dropped below one to 0.98, which would be good for top-10 in
the country.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After hosting LIU-Brooklyn on Wednesday, the Seawolves will head to the nation’s capital for a three-game series with Georgetown. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Shirley Strum Kenny Student Arts Festival was a celebration of creativity, bringing light to the hidden gems of Stony Brook’s various art galleries. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last Thursday’s first annual “Art Crawl” presented the opportunity to appreciate student and professional work in 30-50 minute segments. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Graduate Master of Fine Arts student Nicole Hixon sits on the committee of the Shirley Strum Kenny Student Arts Festival, also known as the SSK. Hixon proposed the idea of an art crawl in an effort to promote the galleries in this fast and fun way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I was getting tired of students not knowing all the different venues of where to find student art on campus” Hixon said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The first stop on the crawl brought viewers into a minimalistic world of interactive installations, video and open space in the Staller Center’s Zuccaire Gallery. This gallery Features master thesis pieces by Hixon, as well as other Master of Fine Arts students Catherine Katsafouros and Fiona N. Cashell. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hixon’s piece, “The Nest,” provides a safe space for members of the community to come together. The four swings around “The Nest” represent the four directions, accompanied with one of the four natural elements.<span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The next stop on the tour was the Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities, also known as “URECA,” exhibition in the Student Activities Center Gallery, led by intern Dali Jung. Annually URECA sponsors undergraduate student work nominated by faculty.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The crawl concluded with a closing reception of Swiss “sound architects” Zimoun and Flo Kaufman’s exhibit called [KE]3. Dozens of people flooded the Simons Center to enjoy some wine and cheese as they said farewell to the installation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The artists’ work marries technology, kinetic sound, science and art—making the installation seemingly perfect for the venue that specializes in geometry and physics research and education.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The rumble of dense cotton balls bounced off cardboard boxes set a strangely calm background sound originating from his piece “25 cotton balls, 3 screens, 25 cardboard boxes.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This sound overlapped with the hum of metal wires tapping against a white wall in “175 prepared dc-motors, 150 filler wire.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wires left waves of graceful dark markings on a white wall, an unplanned aesthetic to the piece. Infusing multiple senses into one artistic experience emulates the beauty of sound architecture.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Zimoun actually spoke at the Simons Center earlier in the year and explained his simple sound systems with complex behaviors. He said he never gets the same sound twice. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We hear what we see,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Zimoun said. “It is adding something visual to a sound or adding a sound to a visual.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Students had hands-on experience with the initial installation of the piece. They had the opportunity to spend time with Zimoun and his students assembling the three installations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Usually Zimoun’s work is based on site-specific installations, in which case he will go to a space or be invited by an institution to show his work. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He often then creates something that will fit that particular space and only assemble one focal point piece.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We decided that it would be wonderful that he would show several pieces so the students and the community at large would be able to become more familiar with how he works,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Art Program Director/Curator Lorraine Walsh said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As The SSK Arts Festival moves along the month of April, ending on the 28, more shows and crawls will be showcasing Stony Brook’s finest. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The next crawl will be Thursday April 23 at 3 p.m. in the SAC Art Gallery. It will feature work from MAMA, or Modern Art By Modern Artist.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

As students enter the west entrance of the Charles B. Wang Center at Stony Brook University, they are greeted by an over-blown black and white portrait of a woman.
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Asian woman is dressed in a collared shirt and a satchel is hung in front of her, with the knot tied at her shoulder. Her left hand is lightly grasped around her child, who is held close to her chest in the satchel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The title, printed in white and baby blue, reads, “Love and Blessings: The Art of Baby Carriers,” one of four exhibitions currently on display at the Wang Center.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Over 20 pieces of beautifully designed baby satchels representing the culture of various Chinese and Taiwanese ethnic groups are on display in the Skylight Gallery</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The exhibition, sponsored by the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of China and the Hanlin Chinese Culture Association, shows the diverse ethnic makeup of the Chinese population through various design patterns, symbols and layouts of a common household item that is still being used today. The baby carriers are taken from five ethnic groups in southeast China: Miao, Zhuang, Dong, Shui and Yi, in addition to Han, the dominating population and aboriginal tribe of Taiwan.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While most of the carriers consist of two blocks of fabric with two-to-four straps extended on adjacent sides, differences lie in the size of the carriers. One Miao baby carrier spans over 12 feet. </span></p>
<p class="p1">Shui carriers feature floral patterns with thick embroideries, whereas Zhuang carriers favor geometric patterns and pockets for added warmth and symbolic meanings. Dong carriers often feature the design of the Chinese character for “water well,” which is a symbol for longevity and prosperity.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Moving toward Jasmine dining hall, several paintings depicting Japanese ramen shops and shopping centers are hung on the wall separating the dining hall and the exhibit space, named Jasmine Gallery.</span></p>
<p class="p1">“The Everyday Joys of Japan: Paintings By Jiro Osuga” is a series of oil paintings that highlight Japanese urban culture of food and leisure through a foreign perspective.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Osuga, a Japanese artist born in Japan who spent his youth in Nigeria and England, uses his paintings to express the feeling of displacement as a youth, both geologically and psychologically.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The psychological impact of displacement can be felt through his paintings. His paintings are in a style similar to Japanese comic books, with sharp outlines, varying facial expressions, attention to detail and a theme centered on Japanese life. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The paintings reflected Osuga’s Japanese identity, yet the use of oil and canvas signifies his European influenced upbringing as an artist.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Despite its proximity to the dining hall, students walk past the exhibit without as much as turning their head. When asked for comment, many refused while the rest simply admitted to never have seen the exhibit.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, the exhibit’s guest book provided a thoughtful comment from a viewer of the gallery.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Navita Khaira, a sophomore arts major wrote: “I’m incredibly intrigued by your artwork, the way it unfolds to reveal a deeper look into Japanese everyday life. Truly enjoy watching. I’ve become a fan.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Jasmine video room, interviews with Dr. Jack G. Shaheen of New York University play on a loop. The video is apart of the “A is for Arab: Stereotypes in popular U.S. Culture” exhibit shown at the Theater Lobby Gallery.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Drawn from Shaheen’s archival book of the same title, “A is for Arab” is structured as an educational exhibit with eight pairs of collage posters.The posters are filled with excerpts from comic books, books, films, cartoons, games, advertisements and toys depicting negative stereotypes of Arabs in western culture, paired with a few paragraphs explaining each stereotypical representation and a quote by Shaheen.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The real attention-grabber for the exhibit is the use of double exposure of collages for each panel and the theme of children’s primers as the narrative.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Laura Chen-Schultz, deputy director of the A/P/A Institute at New York University, one of the exhibit organizers, explained the reason in an email.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The purpose of the double exposure style of the panels was to demonstrate how the images we see on the front side/surface shouldn’t be accepted at mere face value, and to help viewers understand that there’s always more behind what they are seeing than often meets the eye.”</span></p>
Chen-Schultz said the use of Children’s primer is to emphasize how stereotypes are ingrained in Americans at an early age and reiterated throughout their life, something that must be changed at every level.
<p class="p1">The “A is for Arab” exhibit is provided by the same organizer from New York University who installed the “Marvels and Monsters: Unmasking Asian Images in U.S. Comics 1942-1986” exhibit at the Wang Center in the spring of 2014.</p>
 “I remember that exhibition was so well received, I realized students are akin to such topics so I asked the organizers of NYU to exhibit another one,” Jinyoung Jin, the associate director of cultural programming at the Wang Center, said.

Tucked beneath the central staircase connecting the first and second floor is the Zodiac Gallery, where woodblock prints by Tibetan monks are on display. This is a part of the “Pearl of the Snowlands: Tibetan Buddhist Printing From The Derge Parkhang” exhibit.

The exhibit is a part of the collaborate project between the Derge Parkhang, publication and distribution center for Tibetan texts, Wesleyan University and Columbia College Chicago.

Displayed on the wall by the exhibit it say that it is the first authorized U.S. exhibition of such work. It demonstrates the level of craftsmanship, dedication and determination the Tibetan monks possess.
<p class="p1">While the exhibitions are certainly educational and awe-inspiring, the layout of the Wang Center, in relation to Jasmine dining hall, played a role in how each exhibit is viewed.</p>
<p class="p1">“Since it’s not a conventional museum, we get a lot of foot traffic but for various reasons,” Jin said. “My job is to guide the viewers by giving them a sense of direction to each exhibit.”</p>
<p class="p1">Jin does so by utilizing different background colors for each exhibit.</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s so hidden away from campus that people aren’t gonna come all the way here to see some art,” Anwen Lewis, a music major who often goes to the Wang Center for lunch and to wander the galleries, said.</p>
<p class="p1">“They need to do a better job advertising,” Michaela Carrillo, a marine biology major, said.</p>
<p class="p1">“I kinda like that no one knows about it though,” Lewis said.</p>

Two of these apply to Stony Brook University, rejecting funding to Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium and a proposed indoor practice facility and exam center. <em>PHOTO CREDIT: GOVERNOR'S PRESS OFFICE</em>[/caption]

Of the 184 vetoes New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo issued pertaining to facets of the 2015-2016 Enacted Budget, two items in relation to Stony Brook University were vetoed as “unconstitutional alterations of the Executive’s reappropriations,” according to a <a href="http://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-vetoes-184-legislative-additions-2015-16-enacted-budget">press release</a> from the Governor’s office on Monday, April 13.

Cuomo vetoed $22.2 million allocated for stadium improvements and locker room facilities at Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium, citing that the allocation was an <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/governor.ny.gov/files/atoms/files/2015-16_BudgetVetoes.pdf">“unconstitutional alteration of a reappropriation contained in the Executive Budget submission, because it changes the purpose of the reappropriation by removing the computational biomedicine visualization and drug development magnet facility at Stony Brook and substituting therefor stadium improvement and locker room facilities.”</a>

Originally, the $22.2 million was marked in the 2008-09 University Budget to fund a “computational biomedicine visualization and and drug development magnet facility,” but this money was reallocated to the stadium’s facilities, according to the budget update provided at the April 6 University Senate meeting.

The second veto rejected $2 million set aside for an indoor practice facility and exam center, citing that this offense was an <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/governor.ny.gov/files/atoms/files/2015-16_BudgetVetoes.pdf">“unconstitutional alteration of a reappropriation contained in the Executive Budget submission, because it changes the purpose of the reappropriation by… (iii) removing the computational biomedicine visualization and drug development magnet facility at Stony Brook and substituting therefor an indoor practice facility/exam center.”</a>

The money was supposed to be used to expand and renovate the stadium after the Athletics Department partnered with <a href="http://populous.com/">Populous</a>, an architectural design company, to conduct a feasibility study.

The feasibility study looks to plan out an expansion and renovation project for Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium. The money proposed in the budget was meant to help pay for what the study reveals and determine how much would need to be raised privately, Stony Brook Athletic Director Shawn Heilbron said in an interview on April 8.

The study was launched this month to survey the current stadium and the surrounding area.

Populous developed Marlins Park in Miami, Amway Arena in Orlando and The O2 arena in London. The company also transformed England’s capital for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Populous has also drawn up plans for a new Milwaukee Bucks arena to replace the Bradley Center.

At the time of publication, a Stony Brook Athletics representative was not available for comment.

In a statement from the university, Assistant Athletic Director for Communications Brian Miller said that "The Executive announced a decision to veto 184 appropriations, and we have been informed that there may be technical or legal issues with the appropriations that prompted this action. We look forward to working with the Executive and the two houses of the legislature to overcome these issues in the future."

<strong>Update: April 15, 2015
</strong><em>At 9:43 p.m. on Tuesday night, Assistant Athletic Director for Communications Brian Miller issued a statement from the university about Governor Andrew Cuomo's veto decision. </em>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Georgia; color: #333333;">“Penn State, Let’s Break”</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Georgia; color: #333333;">That was the rallying cry of a group of over twenty Stony Brook students and alumni for months. To some, they are known as the “Hate Team." To others, they are simply the SBU Contingent. Their event of choice for the April 10-12th weekend: The Pennsylvania State University Humans vs. Zombies Invitational.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Georgia; color: #333333;">Housing was booked, carpooling was haphazardly and belatedly organized, the cost of the two being shared evenly between them. Finally, the time to make the six hour drive from Suffolk County to the Borough of State College had arrived.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Georgia; color: #333333;">The sixth annual Penn State Invitational welcomed over 400 participants from countless community colleges and universities from all across the country. Some came to have fun, others came to win. But their objective was still the same: survive an onslaught of zombies, many of whom would eventually be their own team members and friends, for twelve hours.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Georgia; color: #333333;"> Very few would come close to achieving that goal.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Georgia; color: #333333;">Photographer and reporter Christopher Cameron was there with his GoPro, documenting the entire game--even after his "death."</span></p>

After scoring a historic ten goals against UMass Lowell on Friday, junior attackman Brody Eastwood was honored with his second America East Co-Player of the Week award.

Eastwood's career-high ten goals are tied for second-most in a game in America East history.  He added an assist to round out his already impressive stat line, giving him eleven points on the night.

The star attackman's efforts lead Stony Brook, scoring half of the Seawolves’ points, as they defeated UMass Lowell, 20-9.

When Stony Brook took on Lehigh, Eastwood looked for a repeat performance. Instead of the amazing ten, Eastwood only netted a single goal in Stony Brook's 12-11 loss.

He won the spot last week for his eleven goal weekend against 19/19 Princeton and Quinnipiac. Eastwood found the back of the net five times against Princeton and scored six goals against Quinnipiac.

Eastwood's second 11-goal weekend has pushed him over the 50 goal mark for the season. He has 51 goals for the season, giving him his best scoring season since his freshman year when he netted 44 goals. His next goal will break Kevin Crowley's single-season record of 51-goals set in 2010.

On the field, Eastwood has been a go-to scorer for the Seawolves.  He already leads the team in goals and is looking to take that one step further and break Seawolves history. He is getting ready set Seawolves history, as he is tied with Crowley for most goals in a season. Eastwood is also second on the team in points with 55, trailing senior midfielder Mike Rooney's 77.  Eastwood's 3.92 goals per game is the second best in NCAA Division I.

Eastwood shared the America East accolade with junior Vermont goalkeeper Justin Rosenberg. Rosenberg stopped 18 of 28 shots against UMBC, giving Vermont its first win against UMBC in program history.

Up next for Eastwood and the Seawolves is a home game against Duke on Wednesday, April 15 at 7 p.m.. Afterwards, they take on their America East rivals Binghamton at home on Sunday, April 19 at 1 p.m..]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Submitted by Kenneth Myers. Myers is a fifth-year double major in chemistry and mathematics. He has been active in USG since March 2011 and is currently the Vice President of Student Life. </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><em>Have a response to an article published by the Statesman? Send a Letter to the Editor to editors@sbstatesman.com.</em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As the school year comes to a close, most students begin preparing for their second or third round of midterms and eventually for finals. Studying for these exams is often on the forefront of student concerns at Stony Brook. However, two other aspects of campus life are also on students’ minds: the end of the year concert and club budgets. Both of which are related to the operations at the Undergraduate Student Government (USG). I have been an active member in USG for over four years, the longest of any current student, and believe that I can give some insight on both of these topics.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Brookfest:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the last four years, USG has consistently put on concerts that could be categorized as pop, rap, hip-hop or EDM. Because of this, USG has often been criticized for catering to a segment of the campus while eschewing the preferences of others. USG has even been accused of racism for only booking black artists to headline Brookfest. Furthermore, the people who feel that they are not being represented by these concerts often make themselves the most heard on social media.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This year, we made it our mission at USG to not only hold the most, but also the most diverse concerts in recent years. We believe we have accomplished this mission. In the fall, we had a pop/electronic rock concert (which featured Icona Pop, Five Knives, Lowell) and a rap/EDM concert, “Back to the Brook.”Coming into the spring we said that Brookfest would not be another rap/EDM concert like the previous fall and spring. After previously failing to book Panic! At The Disco in the fall, we managed to secure them for the spring concert and also plan a Streetlight Manifesto concert, the first ska performance in nearly three years. For the first time, we are putting on four large scale shows while also having a pop rock band headline Brookfest, in addition to also having ska, rap, hip-hop, EDM, pop and electronic rock all perform in one year. This year has shown more growth than any previous year I have been here.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Despite this, USG is criticized for Brookfest because Panic! At The Disco is either not “relevant” or because they wanted another rap/EDM concert. I think this is another example of the unhappy people being the loudest on social media. People who criticized us in the past have now praised us and people who have gotten their way every year are now on the other side of the table. What people need to realize is that not everyone is going to be happy 100 percent of the time and that this is a step in the right direction of trying to satisfy everyone at least once per year, instead of satisfying one segment of the population for the entire year. I would also like to point out that the concert choice could not have been that bad because, at the time of writing this, the Google form for ticket sign-ups has only been live for 12 hours with over 3,000 people having signed up, over 500 of which have said they would like to bring a non-student guest. The capacity of this concert is only about 3,200, so I welcome anyone to tell us now that this concert was still a bad choice.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Club Budgets:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the previous senate meeting, on Thursday, April 12, the senate voted to approve the budget for the 2015-2016 academic year. I was very outspoken at this meeting about my issues with this budget </span>and it is my opinion that it is the absolute worst budget to be approved by the Senate in recent years.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To start, clubs budgets were cut by about $170k largely due to their failure to apply for a budget by the deadline. This year, the law was strictly enforced while in previous years it was only loosely enforced. Numerous clubs showed up to the Senate meeting to request more money than what they were given or cut by. Among them included the Science Fiction Forum, the Chinese Association at Stony Brook (CASB) and WUSB, the radio station on campus. At the start of the meeting, there was $300k in unallocated funds and by the end of the meeting only $50k[of that amount] had been allocated.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>$40k of which went to SAB, which I told the senate did not need more than $30k. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This meant that there was still $250k left unallocated at the end of the meeting when the budget was approved. To put this in perspective, when the budget was approved in 2014, there was only $50k in unallocated funds. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Clubs that have been cut completely are only eligible for 50 percent of their budget through the fall revisions process. This means that next fall, the clubs that were cut are only eligible for about $85k of the $170k or so they were cut by. Removing this from the unallocated funds leads to $165k, at minimum, in the budget next year to protect USG from over-expenditures this year. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While USG did have a deficit last year due to the expenditures of SAB in 2014, SAB has been buffering itself all year so that it would not go over again. The only area that I have heard USG having a deficit this year is in payroll due to an increase in assistant hours and the increase in minimum wage. This deficit, however, does not add up to the
amount of $165k. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was further curious that a sports club, which I’ve been told was put on probation for at least the next year for trashing a hotel room, was rumored to have had its entire budget in jeopardy because of its actions and has in the past allegedly assaulted a graduate student at The Bench, ended up with an increase in its budget. What message do you think this sends to students when we hold clubs more accountable for a budget deadline than for causing property damage at a hotel?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In short, there is more than enough unallocated funds to give to all of the clubs that were at the senate meeting on Thursday, and then some. I think USG needs to realize that we are not a business. We are not here to make money or save it, we are here to spend the Student Activity Fee in a way that benefits all of the students. It is good to be fiscally conservative to prevent over expenditures but when you have a $165k surplus it is fiscally irresponsible. When we have a surplus this big, people will question why USG needs more money. This question is sure to be provoked if an increase in the Student Activity Fee is proposed this year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">                     </span></span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I’ve got Skittles in my mouth. Do you want to taste the rainbow?</em>
<em> It’s a good thing I have my library card because I’m checking you out.</em>
<em> You must be from Pearl Harbor because you’re the bomb.</em></p>
Gone are the days when people had corny pick-up lines and I don’t think the phrase “slow curve” has been used since "The Lizzie McGuire Movie" came out in 2003. I’ve conducted some research—which may not be up to Stony Brook research standards, but is interesting nonetheless—and asked some people if they had a go-to move. It revealed that very few people even have a go-to move they use when it comes to picking someone up other than “I introduce myself” or “I just go talk to them." Many people also claim to have no move at all.

To be fair, corny pickup lines almost never work, but that does not mean I don’t wish people at least had the guts to try. It isn’t like shaking my hand or asking your friend to tell me that you thought I was cute at a Halloween party last semester is getting you very far anyway.

Most people agree confidence is sexy. Nothing says "confident" like bravely walking up to a woman and asking her what has 142 teeth and holds back The Incredible Hulk. Fortunately, there are some who make the game a little more interesting, even at the risk of facing rejection.

Some people just stare at their target. Others show off their intelligence, while another goes up and plays with a lady’s hair. One gentleman approaches girls and says he is falling in love with her. Someone else relies on his grasp of foreign languages to speak the language of love. Still another plays the chase, hot one minute and cold the next. One girl literally picks a girl up while trying to pick her up. I’m personally a fan of this move (insert winking emoticon here).

While conducting research for this article, I was asked multiple times what my move is and so I shall summarize Kate’s Three-Step Attack.
<ol>
	<li>Step one: make eye contact and coyly bite lower lip.</li>
	<li>Step two: once contact is established, confide something weird about myself. If he says it’s cute, which it usually isn’t, he is interested. Example: I reclaim my virginity when I’m in a stubborn mood.</li>
	<li>Step three: get annoyed at listening to him talk about himself and either kiss him or walk away–also mood-dependent.</li>
</ol>
So if walking up and introducing yourself does not work and the corny pickup lines (while quite amusing) are generally ineffective, what does work? Unfortunately, insanely good looks seem to be one of the most helpful factors, though it is not the only factor.

A generally successful way for a heterosexual man to successfully initiate conversation with a heterosexual woman—besides having washboard abs and carrying around a fluffy puppy—is as follows: Do not introduce yourself first; it comes off as majorly-creeperesque. Start off with a witty or funny comment about the present situation. Warning: if she doesn’t laugh or smile, run away.

If she laughs and not the “ew why is this random person talking to me laugh,” but a real laugh—ask her to get a cup of coffee or for her screenname (I know no one uses screen names, but if she’s over the age of 17, and she better be, it may make her laugh again).

So what can you take away from this? Don't sit on the sidelines or just shake their hand and introduce yourself. If you want to get someone's number, you have to just ask.

How you do that, though, is entirely up to you.]]></content:encoded>

Gov. Kathy Hochul, left, visits Stony Brook University on Monday, April 13 for a presentation by Associate Dean Christopher Gobler of SoMAS on combating pollution of Long Island's shores. Gobler's presentation was given on behalf of the New York State Center for Clean Water Technology. <em>MANJU SHIVACHARAN / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

New York Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul visited Stony Brook University on Monday, April 13 for a presentation about the impact of excessive nitrogen in Long Island soil and water and the solutions the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences developed to battle the contamination.

Christopher Gobler, associate dean of Research at SoMAS, gave the presentation on behalf of the New York State Center for Clean Water Technology (CCWT), which was established at SBU in the fall.

Gobler said there were three main goals of the presentation: to inform Hochul of the impacts of excessive nitrogen, to introduce the alternative methods innovated by the CCWT and to contribute to the Long Island Nitrogen Mitigation and Management Plan, which was recently given a $5 million budget from the state.

“It is clearly something that Stony Brook can assist in and help with,” Gobler said. “So the goal was to make sure she understood that Stony Brook is at the ready to assist with that plan, bring the best science to that plan.”

Hochul said she hopes government funds can be a driving force for the CCWT to partner with businesses to commercialize its developments. For graduates, this would lead to training in the private industry and more jobs.

“This is a perfect example of the governor’s idea to have a START-UP NY in place,” Hochul said. “And what is does is it aligns the private sector, with the public sector, with academia.”

This issue exists beyond Long Island, existing in states like Rhode Island, New Jersey and Florida. If the university is successful in marketing its septic system and cesspool solutions, then this industry can reach all over the world, according to Hochul.

Gobler said Long Island is a watershed, so materials on land enter the groundwater and surface water through precipitation, infiltration and evaporation. As the population of Suffolk County increases, the nitrogen levels rise. As a result, marshes have decreased by 20 to 80 percent around Long Island. Marshes are crucial to prevent flooding, such as that observed during Hurricane Sandy.

According to Gobler, since 1930, there has been a 90 percent loss in seagrass, a vital home for fish, which subsequently resulted in a loss of an estimated $10 million in revenue for Long Island since 1975. An increase in nitrogen affects marine life in two ways: It produces harmful algae which contaminate seafood and also leads to low oxygen levels, a condition known as hypoxia, that harms marine life. According to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, 70 percent of Long Island coastal waters are inadequate for fish survival.

Gobler said most homes on Long Island have a septic system that leaks nitrogen into the environment. The new technology would remove the nitrate before it ends up in groundwater, a process known as denitrification. There are nearly 360,000 septic systems that need to be improved, with each unit costing almost $50,000. The research would work to provide the smartest nitrogen regulating systems, reduce costs and lower infrastructure.

As a swimmer, Southampton Town Supervisor Anna Throne-Holst noticed the difference in the waters first hand where she lives on the bay and knew she had to help solve the problem. She calls the research center the "Silicon Valley" of waste water technology, and said these meetings are important because government officials experience the research on a personal level.

“It has an economic development and job creation idea behind it,” Throne-Holst said. “The fact that the Lieutenant Governor came out here and took the time to hear the presentation and the excitement that Stony Brook is generating around this is great.”

According to Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Dennis Assanis, the research of the CCWT is an exciting experiential learning opportunity for not just graduate students, but undergraduates as well. He said the goal is to get students of SoMAS, the Civil Engineering Program and the Sustainability Studies Program to apply what they have learned in the lecture hall to this real-life issue.

“There will be lots of undergraduate opportunities at all levels, some who will just be doing research of literature and other cases experiments or analyses,” Gobler said. “There is always room for [undergraduates] as well. At least for me, it’s always been part of my research—a tiered team with undergraduates in the mix.”]]></content:encoded>

The USG senate has extended the deadline to pass the 2015-2016 budget to April 24. <em>MANJU SHIVACHARAN / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

At an emergency meeting on Wednesday, April 15, the <a href="http://sbstatesman.com/tag/undergraduate-student-government/">Undergraduate Student Government</a> senate extended the deadline to pass the 2015-2016 budget to April 24 after President Garry Lachhar vetoed the nearly $3.2 million budget that the senate passed at its <a href="http://sbstatesman.com/2015/04/14/campus-briefing-sab-to-get-40k-raise-in-usg-2015-2016-budget-proposal/">April 9</a> meeting.

The reason Lachhar gave for the veto was the amount of money that was left in unallocated funds. The amount of unallocated funds in the original proposed budget was $303,324.73, compared to $52,966.23 for the 2014-2015 year.

“I thought it was fiscally irresponsible to have that much unallocated when clubs have demonstrated need for it,” Lachhar said.

Treasurer Kathryn Michaud explained the budget committee was being “conservative” while preparing the proposed budget.

“We weren’t assuming that we were going to be getting money in from an increase in the Student Activity Fee because that in itself would be fiscally irresponsible, to assume we would have money that we don’t actually have,” Michaud said. “Plus we haven’t even determined an amount that we want to increase the <a href="http://sbstatesman.com/tag/student-activity-fee/">Student Activity Fee</a> potentially by.”

Vice President of Academic Affairs Steven Adelson said <a href="http://sbstatesman.com/tag/usg/">USG</a> does need some unallocated funds, but the conversation should be about how much stays unallocated.

“In previous years we’ve never had this substantial amount of unallocated [funds],” Adelson said. “I don’t think it’s unreasonable to have an equal amount of unallocated funds next year than we did had in this past year.”

Michaud said she will provide the senate with a breakdown of how much money was left unallocated in the proposed budget.

She also said all amendments that were made to the budget at the April 9 senate meeting, including the $40,000 increase given to the Student Activities Board, are now null and void due to the veto.

USG funds clubs and organizations with the Student Activity Fee paid by all Stony Brook University full-time undergraduate students. USG agencies like SAB, which organizes concerts, as well as Roth Regatta and other large-scale events on campus, are also funded by the Student Activity Fee.

“If the Senate Budget Committee and/or Senate fail to approve a budget by the third week of the month of April, the Executive Council shall assume the responsibility to formulate the budget in an Executive Council meeting and passed with a two-thirds majority,” the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/#folders/0B8KNfnC3m3RxcTVvV1pBTXBFWEk/0B8KNfnC3m3RxYnZiZUU0blhfUEE">USG Code</a> states. “Once the budget is approved the Treasurer shall have the budget certified by the Office of Student Affairs as required by the SUNY Chancellor Guidelines.”]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_38969" align="alignleft" width="600"]<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/goincase/8048745695/in/photostream/"><img class="wp-image-38969 size-full-width" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/8048745695_b85e656afa_o-600x400.jpg" alt="PHOTO CREDIT : INCASE" width="600" height="400" /></a> Tyler, the Creator (above), released his new album, <em>Cherry Bomb</em>, on April 13. Two songs released earlier than the drop date featured works by Charlie Wilson, Toro Y Moi and Cole Alexander of the Black Lips. He performed the two singles that were released before the album this year at Coachella. <em>Cherry Bomb</em> is a follow up to his 2013 album, <em>Wolf.</em>  <em>PHOTO CREDIT : INCASE</em>[/caption]

Tyler, the Creator's career is marred with chaos. He is politically incorrect and follows no rules but his own.  His latest album, "Cherry Bomb," is a testament to it.

The album is a sonic jumble filled to the brim with ideas.  In fact, the only thing the album is lacking is clarity, something that it desperately needs.

The lyrical content of the album is all over the place.  For instance, in the second track "BUFFALO," Tyler speaks about the past controversies that have surrounded his career since his mainstream debut. The next three songs go on to reveal his need to buckle down and not mess around.  While the three songs are logically in place with each other by having similar themes, the jump from emotions is unusual.

On the subject of lyrics, Tyler, the Creator continues to disappoint. The usual gay slurs and sex jokes appear over and over again, as well as his references to controversial figures like Donald Sterling. There is no added excitement to his music, it is just him either complaining or trying to become a better person.

The lack of narrative is another disappointing aspect of the album. Tyler, the Creator's first three albums were heavily driven by a narrative. While "Cherry Bomb" is not part of the same story that the first three albums were, there is no story whatsoever on "Cherry Bomb." The album is just a collection of random thoughts that boil down to complaining.

Even though the lyrics are disappointing, the production is marvelous. The diversity shows how much Tyler has grown. Instead of heavy, synth driven songs we see more drums being utilized. The chaotic sound of snares thrashing mixed with crazy synths suits his taste for the crazy. Listeners can hear where he was influenced by other producers and bands like N.E.R.D. and Death Grips.

Another positive for the album is the featured artists. Colombian singer Kali Uchis is prominently featured on the album. Her vocals create a dream-like vibe that help us forget about Tyler, the Creator's forgettable singing voice.  Also featured on the album are Tyler, the Creator's idols Pharrell, Lil' Wayne and Kanye West.  Lil' Wayne even had one of the best verses on the album in the song "SMUCKERS." Schoolboy Q is also featured on the album, marking the second time both artists have appeared on the same song.

Overall, the album is pretty bad. An unfocused lens is ultimately the album's downfall. Instead of a coherent story, like Tyler, the Creator's past work, we see a jumble of superficial ideas that are stale. The only redeeming qualities about the album are the featured artists and the production. The few standouts on the album include "SMUCKERS," "DEATHCAMP" and "The BROWN STAINS OF DARKEESE LATIFAH PART 2 (REMIX)."  Randomness does not create a good album, and Tyler, the Creator proves that.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A walk-off home run by outfielder Bria Green concluded the Stony Brook softball team's sweep of a home doubleheader against Fairfield on Wednesday, winning the matchups 7-2 and 4-2.

"We got two good team wins," Green said.

Despite the lofty score of game one, much of the first game was a pitcher's duel. Stony Brook's Allison Cukrov and Fairfield's Destinee Pallotto each carried shutouts deep into what looked like a low-scoring affair. The game remained scoreless until the bottom of the fifth, when the Seawolves' bats exploded.

Stony Brook scored seven runs on nine consecutive hits to break the scoreless tie. Some highlights from this monstrous inning include a two-run double by Melissa Phelan, a three-run home run by Allie Pisciotta and RBI hits from Shayla Giosia and Lauren Kamachi. It was, in short, one of the best offensive innings Stony Brook has had this season.

"We just made adjustments and started to drive it," Green said.

This inning essentially put the game on ice for the Seawolves. Cukrov continued to dominate, allowing just two runs while recording seven strikeouts in seven stellar innings.

"It feels great to know the offense has my back," Cukrov said. "I just went out there and kept pitching tough."

In the following game, freshman Maddy Neales started for Stony Brook against Fairfield junior Lauren Falkanger. Neales struggled early, allowing a run in each of her first two innings pitched. She was pulled after the top of the fourth in favor of junior Jane Sallen as Stony Brook trailed 2-0.

After Neales' day ended, a home run and sacrifice fly from Giosia in the fourth and fifth innings tied the game. On the mound, Sallen controlled the game, allowing just one hit in her three innings of work to keep the game tied.

"Jane did a great job in relief," Seawolves coach Megan Bryant said.

Going into the seventh and final frame, the game remained tied as Green came to the plate with a runner on second.

"I just wanted to get the win and end the game," Greene said.

And with one swing of the bat, she did just that. Greene hit a moonshot to centerfield that ended Stony Brook’s day on a high note. Many spectators were surprised that Fairfield pitched to Green, who came into the day batting .435.

"I was surprised that they pitched to her," Bryant said. "But I'm happy that they did."

The wins on Wednesday extended the Seawolves' win streak to five games. Offensively, Stony Brook has been daunting during the streak, scoring 47 total runs.

"Hitting is contagious," coach Bryant said. "The players fed off each other, so we we've been able to string some hits together."

The Seawolves will look to get their sixth consecutive win in Hempstead, New York tomorrow, when they travel to Hofstra.]]></content:encoded>

The Seawolves would carry this momentum to a 6-4 win over the LIU Brooklyn Blackbirds. <em>MEGAN MILLER / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

Stony Brook came back from a pair of deficits and Matt Senk earned his 700th career victory, in a 6-4 defeat of LIU Brooklyn in an NCAA baseball non-conference matchup Wednesday afternoon.

Andruw Gazzola went 2-for-4 and earned a pair of RBI while Toby Handley had a clutch one-out, two-run double as the Seawolves defeated the Blackbirds in the first matchup between the two teams since 2001.

This victory makes it seven wins in a row for the Seawolves. The streak dates back to early April, with the Seawolves' last loss coming on March 30.

“It beats the alternative,” Senk said with a laugh. “It’s great to take that streak into the Georgetown weekend.”

Handley’s double in the sixth inning was a hot shot down the left-field line, scoring Cole Creighton from second and Cole Peragine all the way from first to give the Seawolves a 5-4 lead, an advantage they would not relinquish over the final three frames.

It was one of Senk’s former players that he defeated, taking down Stony Brook baseball’s first All-American and current LIU Brooklyn Head Coach Alex Trezza. Trezza played from 1999-2002, and was picked to College Baseball Newspaper’s Third Team in 2001 to earn the landmark.

“He’s doing a very good job there and has them playing hard. It was a hard-fought game,” the manager said about Trezza.

It was Nick DiEva who started the matchup, going three innings, with the first inning going roughly.

The freshman hit his first batter and then allowed a Tommy Jakubowski triple two batters later to get the Blackbirds on the board early. An RBI groundout by Melvin Rios made it 2-0 LIU Brooklyn.

Jakubowski would score another run in the fourth when he reached on an infield single and later touched home on Mark Hernandez’s sacrifice fly. The big-hitting lefty finished the night 2-for-3.

DiEva was able to record five strikeouts in the short outing, three of them looking with a nasty curveball.

“His stuff was really good,” Senk said. “He throws hard and his breaking ball was good.”

Three straight base hits by Johnny Caputo, Gazzola and Jeremy Giles gave the Seawolves their first lead of the game at 3-2 in the third. Gazzola’s triple down the right field line was sandwiched between RBI singles up the middle by Caputo and Giles.

Jakubowski’s run tied it, then Hernandez gave LIU a 4-3 lead with a bomb over the right-center field fence off of Tim Knesnik in the seventh, Hernandez's second RBI of the game.

After Creighton and Peragine were able to draw free passes via a hit by pitch and a walk, Handley roped a 3-2 pitch down the left field line to score them both.

Those were two of 11 free passes issued by Blackbird pitchers with three hit by pitches, two of them to Creighton, and eight walks.

“Our guys have been really good at [drawing free passes] all year,” Senk said. They have amassed 134 free passes to 199 strikeouts. “Their patience and strike zone discipline has been really good most of the year.”

Just to ice the victory, Gazzola drew a bases loaded walk to score Peragine in the eighth, who also reached on a base on balls.

The Seawolves will look to extend their winning streak when they take their talents to the nation’s capital and Big East country to take on Georgetown in a three-game set this weekend.]]></content:encoded>

Rooney finished with three goals and two assists on the night. <em> MANJU SHIVACHARAN / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

Senior Mike Rooney once again stamped his name into the Stony Brook men’s lacrosse history books on Wednesday night, breaking the Division I record for points in a season and tying the overall record at 82, while junior Brody Eastwood broke the mark for goals in a season, now at 53, in a tightly-contested loss to Duke, 17-11.

Head Coach Jim Nagle’s team appeared down and out in a packed Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium on Wednesday night, with a 4,860-fan crowd reminiscent of a Seawolves football game in the fall.

Stony Brook fell victim to an eight-goal Duke run in the first half, as the Blue Devils scored at will after falling behind 3-2, but the team did not stop fighting.

“I thought it was a great, hard fought contest between two of the best academic schools in the country,” Nagle said. “I was really proud of the way our guys fought back.”

Down 10-3 with Duke looking ready to steamroll their way back to North Carolina, the Seawolves dug in and rattled off five straight goals to grab the momentum heading into the half.

Freshman Jake Sheets, junior Chris Hughes and Rooney each buried a ball in the back of the net in a span of 63 seconds at the end of the second quarter to turn what could have been a blowout into a battle.

“It was good to get within two at half," Rooney, who had three goals and two assists on the night, said. “Going back out there, we’re still playing hard.”

Sophomore goalkeeper Hayden sprinted down the length of the field with 12 minutes to go in the third quarter, just missing a shot above Duke’s net. It was that kind of nothing-to-lose attitude that kept the Seawolves close to the Blue Devils throughout the game.

“It was a great crowd today, a great experience to play Duke, especially at home,” Rooney said. “It was just fun to get out and play. “

One of the Seawolves' opponents was a familiar face, as Duke sophomore Kyle Rowe, who made a massive impact for the Seawolves last season in the face-off department, came back to the school where he got his first college experience.

“Going into it, I kind of just made myself think that they were any other team,” Rowe, who won 18 of his 20 face-offs on the night, said. “Once the whistle blows I kind of forgot it all.”

Nagle, however, was proud of his team’s effort against two-time defending champion Duke.

“Them being so athletic and competitive raises your level,” Nagle said. “For us to have the experience, the experience playing in front of 5,000 in a big environment like that, we can only grow from it."

Junior Challen Rogers did all he could do, adding two goals and two assists, while classmate Eastwood scored twice

“I think we have a good enough team that we can play with anybody, anytime we step on the field,” Rooney, who will lead the Seawolves against Binghamton on Sunday, said. “We go to win the game.”]]></content:encoded>

Students who visit campus are vastly more likely to enroll than those who don’t. Not everybody has the ability to visit campus, and this gives them as close as we can get to that and really get a sense of what it is to be on campus.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">International students on temporary visas, also knows as students of Non-Resident Alien status, make up 16.86 percent of the University, according to Stony Brook’s Fall 2014 Headcount Enrollment. Out-of-state students comprise 24.2 percent of Stony Brook’s undergraduate enrollment and 44.2 percent of the university’s graduate students.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I think people outside of the greater New York Metro area don’t quite know what’s going on out here,” D’Orso said. “They either think we’re New York City and it’s skyscrapers, or they think we’re farm country. To actually get that visual of what the campus is, walking around and getting a feel for somebody who’s in California or Chile, I think it could be a game-changer.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is possible by using a virtual reality headset such as the Oculus Rift or more affordable Google Cardboard. Although the technology is in its early stages, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions has ideas for how to best utilize it as it develops. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I’d like some of our recruiters to have the ability to take some of these with them on the road,” Stefan Hyman, the assistant provost for Enrollment Strategies, Communications and Analytics, said. “Simply going to Brooklyn and New York City where there are a lot of students who have a lot of interest in Stony Brook but haven’t had the chance to visit yet or whether they’re going across the country.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I think at least for now we would bring one or two of these on the road with us to a visit or a college fair or something along those lines,” Hyman added. “But the fact is, it’s a live public website, so if you happen to have a Google Cardboard, you could go bring this up wherever you are. The technology is not exclusive.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The current version of the virtual campus tour allows visitors to course through various locations such as the Staller Steps, Zebra Path and LaValle Stadium and view them in panoramic 3D. Future plans are to “incorporate some more multimedia content in the form of video,” according to Hyman. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“In terms of other next steps: some focus groups with students, trying to talk to high school students or admitted students who are considering Stony Brook right now to get their impressions of it, try to take their feedback and incorporate it into future iterations,” he said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hyman believes Stony Brook’s deal with YouVisit is also economically beneficial towards both parties.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Right now there’s no additional cost that we’re paying YouVisit for this,” Hyman said. “They’re very interested in piloting new technology, and that relationship has worked out pretty well in previous years.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I think one of the nice things about being who we are and where we are is that because [YouVisit is] based in New York City, we’re easy access for them,” D’Orso added. “And so it’s nice to be able to use a big public top-ranked research university as sort of a guinea pig for new technology. We’re happy to be the guinea pig for new technology.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although Stony Brook is merely taking its first step into the new technology, the admissions office is excited for what the future holds.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I think if there’s something technology-wise that will help the admissions experience, it’s upon us to try it,” D’Orso said. “It’s the kind of thing that could provide a lot of value.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

The teams were judged based on the audience applause - the winning duo was Chris Tanaka, coordinator of Campus LGBTQ services and Jennifer Luk, treasurer of the Ballroom Dance Team. The duo swung to the song "Sugar Pie Honey Bunch."  <em>CHRISTOPHER CAMERON / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

The time came once again for the annual Dancing with the SBU Stars event. This year's dancers made their mark on Wednesday, April 15 on the Staller Steps, where over 70 students gathered to watch the stars and their partner’s dance for the audience’s votes.

Wolfie opened the show with his partner, a Stony Brook Ballroom Dance Team alumna, and the pair captured the crowd’s attention with their performance.

The stars of the event were members of the faculty at SBU. Each was paired with a student.  They performed one dance number and then received comments from the three judges—Catherine-Mary Rivera, associate director for university apartments; Emily Beattie, professional choreographer and dance artist and Vicki Velez, residential hall director of Dreiser College.

The teams decide both the dance and the song they performed to. According to Alexandra Wolf, the co-dance captain of the Stony Brook Ballroom Dance Team, there are no auditions for the event.

The first team was Chris D’Orso, assistant director of admissions, and Diana Santos.  They danced to the song “You Belong with Me” by Taylor Swift. D’Orso said that the experience was like nothing he has ever done before.

Next came Shoshana Hershkowitz, conductor of the Stony Brook Chorale and her partner Napat O-Charoenrat, president of the Ballroom Dance Team. The duo captured the audience with their Cha Cha routine.

Chris Tanaka, coordinator of Campus LGBTQ services, and Jennifer Luk, current treasurer of the Ballroom Dance Team, were the last team to perform.  They danced swing  to the song “Sugar Pie Honey Bunch.”

“What was most challenging is the feeling like I have two left feet,” Tanaka said.  “I am not used to being choreographed.”

After the final team performed and received its comments from the judges, the Ballroom Dance Team performed and entertained the crowd when two members of the dance team danced to the hit song “Happy.”

The audience chose who won the contest—whichever dance team had the loudest applause came in first. After two rounds of applause for each team, Tanaka and Luk won with the loudest and longest applause.

After the contest concluded, the students on the Staller Steps lingered around. Some danced to the music that was replaying from the show.

With all three of the dance teams practicing for two-to-three weeks, they shined bright for the students and faculty with their hard work and unique style choice and they had fun doing it.

“The purpose [of the event] was to have fun and to get the staff involved with the students,” Wolf said.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_39050" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-39050 size-full-width" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ClintonBishopRally_Khalifa11-600x400.jpg" alt="HEATHER KHALIFA / THE STATESMAN " width="600" height="400" /> Hillary Clinton, former first lady, announced her candidacy for President on Sunday, April 14. Rowe writes, "There is a gigantic, super-important question to answer if we vote Clinton into office: How will Bill react to having the roles reversed? Heck, what would we call Bill?" <em>HEATHER KHALIFA / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

I was surfing the internet this week and I came across something that made it feel like I was back in 1991—and it wasn’t the old Sizzler ad that went viral. It was talking about the idiosyncrasies of the possible upcoming race between Florida governor Jeb Bush and Democratic contender Hillary Clinton.

That’s right, folks: it appears that for November 2016, the race is most likely going to be Bush vs. Clinton 2: Electric Boogaloo. However, while we know exactly what to expect if we vote another Bush into office, there is a gigantic, super-important <span style="line-height: 1.5;">question to answer if we vote Clinton into office: How will Bill react to having the roles reversed? Heck, what would we call Bill?</span>

Obviously, we will not be calling Bill “First Lady.” However, the etymology of the term “lady” makes it difficult for choosing an appropriate male counterpart. See, “lady” comes from Old English, and it <a title="Definition of lady" href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/lady">meant</a> “wife of a lord.”  As popular as Game of Thrones is nowadays, we cannot be calling Bill Clinton “First Lord.” And while the literal term “lady” comes from “dough maker,”<strong> </strong>I think we should reserve “First Dough Maker” for the title of Clinton’s rap mixtape.

So what else is there?

For Clinton himself, the obvious answer seems to be simply, “Mr. President.” It’s what people call him now and it has worked for two hundred years. But let's be a little forward-thinking. Unless the follow-up to Hillary is going to be Claire Underwood, the next female President will not have a previously-presidential spouse. What will we call <em>him</em>?

The front-runner seems to be “First Gentleman,” but that is a mouthful. Let’s get a little creative with our options.

“First Sire” sounds too British and brings to mind the phrase “to sire” children, which only seems apt because we’re talking about Bill Clinton. “First Husband” is a little easier on the ears, but it doesn’t really work. The Office of the First Lady has been filled by female non-wives in the past, as we have had unmarried presidents (in all likelihood, someone like Chelsea Clinton would take care of the hostess role for Hillary, but then we don’t get the fun of imagining saxophone-themed White House china).

Bill definitely has a “First Dude” type of vibe, but unfortunately, thats not going to happen. However, Todd Palin went by that title when his wife was governor of Alaska, because of course that is what Sarah Palin’s husband would go by. <a title="Bill Clinton jokes about his title" href="http://onpolitics.usatoday.com/2015/01/27/bill-clinton-hillary-president-first-title/">Bill himself suggested</a> “Adam,” as in “Adam and Eve,” which was probably a joke, but makes me hope some some obscure relative of John Quincy Adams gets the position and gets called “Adam Adams.”

Hillary suggested “First Man” or “First Mate.” “First Man” sounds as boring as a Mike Huckabee presidential campaign, but “First Mate” has promise. With some tweaking, it has potential.

Here is my proposal: “First Consort.” It is classy and flexible, you can use it for any gender or marital status. It rolls of the tongue, and you can still call First Ladies either title. My advice is to simply enjoy the insanity of this upcoming election. Both Democrats and Republicans will get to savor the idea of First Consort Bill Clinton telling inappropriate jokes to an intern about the White House Easter eggs.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_39385" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-39385 size-full-width" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/150419_iPhone_Manju.Shivacharan_2525-600x400.jpg" alt="MANJU SHIVACHARAN / THE STATESMAN" width="600" height="400" /> A recent study by vouchercloud revealed that 53 percent of U.S. children will own a cell phone by the age of 7. Benson writes, "I don’t know when this happened, but all of a sudden it seems like too many elementary schoolers have a cell phone, two tablets and five of every generational iPod." <em>MANJU SHIVACHARAN / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

Last week, my cousin sent me a Snapchat.

I know that sounds completely normal; a lot of people talk to their cousins on the daily.

So let me rephrase that.

Last week, my ten year-old cousin sent me a Snapchat from her own iPad.

Does anybody else see the problem with that sentence? Correct me if I’m wrong, though I’m totally not, but not only is ten too young to be taking on the responsibility of a cell phone or tablet, it seems almost unnecessary at such a young age.

I witnessed both my cousins, eight and ten years old, receive their iPad minis for Christmas, squeal with high-pitched excitement and then immediately start downloading apps. My cousin even asked me if I had specific games on my phone, and then yelled at me for not having them because “everybody is playing it!”

I don’t know when this happened, but all of a sudden it seems like too many elementary schoolers have a cell phone, two tablets and five of every generational iPod.

A recent study performed by vouchercloud revealed that the average age for a first-time cell phone user is six years old, and that 53 percent of American children will have owned a cell phone by the age of  seven.

Yes, you read that correctly—six years old. SIX. They are practically still in the womb at that age. What on earth do they need a phone for at such a young age?

When asked this question, 31 percent of the parents who participated in the survey said they wanted to reach their child easily, 25 percent wanted their kids to keep in touch with friends and family and 20 percent said they felt their kids needed it to keep up with their friends.

To this I have two responses:

One: I don’t recall how much knowledge I possessed at 11 or 12, but I can tell you right now it sure as hell was not a lot; not enough to justify having a phone that can call, email, Snapchat, text and FaceTime. I get the importance of safety, and a perhaps a regular flip phone for emergencies is understandable. But if you’re in fourth grade and you have an Instagram with 458 pictures on it, girl, you need to fall back.

Two: to the parents that said they felt their child needed it to keep up with their friends: are you kidding me? I got my first smartphone when I was 18 and going off to college. Sure, there were times in high school when having a smartphone would have been fun, but did I fall behind? My friends didn’t drop me because I couldn’t Snap them or be part of the group chat.

Matthew Wood, the managing director at vouchercloud, commented in an article about the survey, saying that because technology is naturally being exposed to children at younger and younger ages, it’s going to become apart of their lives.

“It’s not necessarily the bad thing it’s often made out to be; children learn about taking responsibility for things, looking after their possessions and they are much easier to contact if needed,” Wood said. “But it’s crucial that they use this technology in a way that doesn’t affect their normal social skills and growth.”

I’m not saying kids nowadays are going to go hide in caves with their iPhones and Androids and forget to make friends, but it seems odd to think that a ten-year-old could honestly need something like that.

Suddenly I feel as if I have reached the age where I am looking down at the younger generations, shaking my head and thinking, “What in God’s name are they doing? That’s not how we did it as children so they must be doing it wrong!” Am I now the old, angry grandma swinging her cane angrily at the young generations for doing everything wrong, or am I right in saying that the age of six is too young to start being trusted with a proper cell phone or tablet?

I would rather be the old, angry grandma because having a cell phone is a fairly large responsibility and you need to earn that responsibility rather than have it handed to you.

As for the elementary schoolers who are begging for smartphones: they come from a time when if one drops his phone, the phone breaks. I came from a time when if you dropped the phone, it broke the floor.

I started from the bottom of the indestructible Nokias and worked my way up to the delicate wonders of iPhones and Androids. God forbid that it took me longer than six years.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In what seemed like a never-ending winter that plagued Stony Brook campus for much of the spring 2015 semester, this past weekend's Holi celebration kicked off an unofficial start to spring. Students—and even young children—gathered at the Mendelsohn pit to throw colored powder and celebrate the spring season, similar to how Holi is celebrated in India. The event was hosted by the Hindu Students Council, and has become one of the most highly-anticipated events of the spring semester at SBU, bringing in all walks—and colors—of life. Check out the gallery and video below:

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><strong>By Michaela Kilgallen and Kelly Saberi</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Undergraduate Student Government Executive Council members made promises in their candidacy platforms last year to enhance student life at Stony Brook. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>The Statesman</i> revisited last year’s platform statements to see if the Executive Council members were able to carry out the plans that were promised.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>President Garry Lachhar</b></span></p>


[caption id="attachment_39353" align="alignleft" width="300"]<img class="wp-image-39353 size-half-width" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_3361-300x300.jpg" alt="PHOTO CREDIT: STONYBROOKUSG.ORG" width="300" height="300" /> PHOTO CREDIT: STONYBROOKUSG.ORG[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last year, then-Vice President of Student Life Garry Lachhar had certain goals for his presidency.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He said in his platform statement that he wanted to work with Campus Residences on improving housing conditions. For commuters, he wanted to introduce more parking options.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lachhar also wanted to work with FSA and Campus Dining to lower the price of food and create a better dining hall experience </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He planned to work on the process of class registration in order to make it easier to navigate. Like many of the others on the executive board, he wanted to create more study spaces for students to collaborate. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the time of publication, Lachhar could not be reached for comment. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Treasurer Kathryn Michaud</b></span></p>


[caption id="attachment_39359" align="alignright" width="300"]<img class="wp-image-39359 size-half-width" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_2531-300x300.jpg" alt="PHOTO CREDIT: STONYBROOKUSG.ORG" width="300" height="300" /> PHOTO CREDIT: STONYBROOKUSG.ORG[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In her platform statement, Kathryn Michaud wanted to improve the relationship between USG and clubs and organizations. She also wanted to make the budgeting process more transparent. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Michaud’s job as treasurer requires her to work 15 hours per week, but according to Michaud, she volunteers at least an extra 45 hours to work with clubs and organizations on their budgets. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the goals she worked on was helping clubs develop. Coming into the academic year, she created the <a href="https://powerpoint.office.live.com/p/PowerPointView.aspx?FBsrc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fattachments%2Ffile_preview.php%3Fid%3D338083676380077%26time%3D1429467167%26metadata&amp;access_token=100001148019691%3AAVKxzg4BB3LZrNsoWlOVy33c8cinBYehIH_Svuk9IM1GnQ&amp;title=USG+Club+Leadership+Guide.pptx" target="_blank">club leadership guide</a> in the form of an easy-to-read PowerPoint that Sen. Jennifer Jeng is working on as her Senator Project.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Michaud said in order to be fair to each club during the spring budget process, each budget started from zero and money was added based on need. Once all the essentials were allocated for, she then allowed each club a 20-minute hearing to ask for funding for the items that are not necessary. From there, the budget committee was able to add money for food, apparel and decorations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We’re students, and we don’t know how every club functions,” Michaud said. “I didn’t think that it was right for clubs in the past not to see what we were looking to cut and have the ability to fight against it.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Michaud looked at key performance indicators in order to judge the earning of each club. These include how many club members came to open forums, participation in leadership conferences, how clubs managed vouchers and leadership quizzes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Michaud said she is trying to make everything more digitized in an effort to reduce the need for paper forms. This would leave less of a chance for documents to get lost and would make sharing files easier.According to Michaud, although she prefers people coming into the office, digitizing will streamline processes and save people time. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We’re trying to make everything very networked so that way you can find everything much easier instead of having the information in many places,” Michaud said. “You don’t have to sift through everything as much.”</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Executive Vice President James Alrassi</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">James Alrassi considers one of his most notable accomplishments to be the <a href="http://sbstatesman.com/2015/02/01/usg-plans-to-implement-my-senators-keeper-act-this-semester-bf/" target="_blank">“Senator’s Project Act,”</a> which requires each USG senator to dedicate his or her efforts to one specific project per semester. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“With 22 individual projects all those like the first semester, hopefully it continues that way,” Alrassi said. “Slowly, if you take care of the small ones, the small problems, you’ll have the larger effect.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Alrassi was passionate about pushing the <a href="http://sbstatesman.com/2014/10/30/renovations-for-pritchard-pool-set-to-begin/" target="_blank">renovation of Pritchard pool</a> forward. As a senator, he wrote a resolution that called on Stony Brook University Samuel L. Stanley Jr. to include the pool renovation in his budget.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He said that although he was not the sole reason the renovations began, USG played a large role in it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Alrassi also compiled several loose USG documents into <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/sbstatesman.com/file/d/0B8KNfnC3m3RxSWFEOTE5TjltR0k/edit" target="_blank">one unified code</a>, which can be found on the organization’s <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B8KNfnC3m3RxcTVvV1pBTXBFWEk&amp;usp=drive_web" target="_blank">Google Drive</a>. Also included are the meeting agendas, which Alrassi made more accessible so students can learn about what topics will be discussed during that meeting. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Alrassi said he has seen an increase in the number of students not only attending the senate meetings but also voicing their views on USG affairs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Vice President of Communications Daniel Chung</b></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Daniel Chung aimed to expand advertising and media outreach for events on campus. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Chung said USG has experienced “some ups and downs some bumps in the road but quality of content has improved.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The <a href="http://sbusg.org/" target="_blank">USG website</a> has undergone some difficulties. According to Chung, website progress has been stunted because they are unable to locate the username or password for an account.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We’ve tried to stay more professional and more transparent to students as far as what we’re trying to improve internally and externally whether its relationships with other organizations, whether its our departments or working together with our fellow colleagues as well,” Chung said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Chung also worked as a liaison between campus media and USG President Garry Lachhar.</span></p>


[caption id="attachment_39352" align="alignleft" width="300"]<img class="wp-image-39352 size-half-width" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_3230-300x300.jpg" alt="PHOTO CREDIT: STONYBROOKUSG.ORG" width="300" height="300" /> PHOTO CREDIT: STONYBROOKUSG.ORG[/caption]
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Vice President of Student Life
Kenneth Myers</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kenneth Myers’s platform focused on increased consideration of student body feedback and criticism of events. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We are doing the most concerts that we’ve ever had at this school in I would say at least a decade,” Myers said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This year, USG also diversified musical genres with artists such as Icona Pop, Lupe Fiasco, 3lau, Streetlight Manifesto, Panic! at the Disco, Twenty One Pilots and B.o.B.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A majority of the Student Activities Board was also interested bringing Rise Against to perform at Brookfest but were unable to bring the band due to scheduling conflicts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although it was not included in his platform, Myers revived the <a href="http://sbusg.org/usg-movie-series/" target="_blank">Committee on Cinematographic Arts Movie Series</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The program offers free movies such as “Guardians of the Galaxy,” “Big Hero 6,” “The Theory of Everything,” “Interstellar,” “The Hunger Games,” “The Imitation Game,” “Inherent Vice” and “The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Myers also pushed for the passage of new bylaws through the senate last fall to give the Student Activities Board the ability to plan out fall events during the summer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In response to the recent negative social media response to the musical acts chosen for concerts, Myers said, “You can’t make some students happy without upsetting others. It’s impossible.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Vice President of Clubs and Organizations Kimberly Pacia</b></span></p>


[caption id="attachment_39351" align="alignright" width="300"]<img class="wp-image-39351 size-half-width" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_3203-300x300.jpg" alt="PHOTO CREDIT: STONYBROOKUSG.ORG" width="300" height="300" /> PHOTO CREDIT: STONYBROOKUSG.ORG[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In her platform, Kimberly Pacia wanted to work with clubs more closely and help to develop increased awareness of policies and procedures. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In previous years, it was the responsibility of the club to contact the vice president of clubs and organizations to inquire about budgets. This year, Pacia reached out to clubs to inform them “of their options and what steps they should be taking to hopefully reach line budget status.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://stonybrookusg.org/ssc/" target="_blank">New clubs that applied for Special Services Council funding</a> doubled from 12 last year to 24 this year, Pacia said. She also created a more efficient turnover process.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Through Google docs, I have documented every step of the SSC process for each club in hopes of making the transition as easy as possible for next year’s VP of Clubs and [Organizations],” Pacia wrote in an email.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The possibility of a creation of club emails was also discussed, but not accomplished. Pacia said that will be something brought up again next year.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Vice President of Academic Affairs Steven Adelson</b></span></p>


[caption id="attachment_39349" align="alignleft" width="300"]<img class="wp-image-39349 size-half-width" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_2125-300x300.jpg" alt="PHOTO CREDIT: STONYBROOKUSG.ORG" width="300" height="300" /> PHOTO CREDIT: STONYBROOKUSG.ORG[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2011, Gov. Andrew Cuomo passed <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/sb/nysuny/overview.html" target="_blank">SUNY 2020</a>, a plan for predictable tuition increase that allows each State and City University of New York campus to increase tuition for in-state students by $300 over five years. This year, Steven Adelson advocated for the renewal of the legislation, which expires in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We went up to Albany after <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EIi_hAoKtdWxKUwmlSiTs2HCa7MF6i8VwkBl5PLanOc/edit" target="_blank">the resolution</a> had passed to speak with assembly persons and state senators about the importance of renewing SUNY 2020 and rational tuition in a new form that is more inclusive of student needs,” Adelson said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Adelson also worked on <a href="http://sbstatesman.com/2014/10/14/campus-briefing-usg-senate-condemns-suny-student-assistant-policy/" target="_blank">student assistant employment restrictions</a> that lowered the maximum working hours from 40 to 29 because of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as “Obamacare.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“It has started a conversation up at SUNY central,” Adelson said. “They’ve done a lot of legal work with it to try and understand if there’s anything that they can do in order to ensure students are able to work the number of hours that they need in order to pay for college.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Adelson said he spends 10 to 20 hours a week in meetings as an undergraduate representative for various university committees, including the Presidential-Provostial “Graduate in Four” Task Force, the University Senate Committee on Student Life and the Faculty Student Association Board of Directors.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“[The meetings attendees are] discussing issues that directly affect students,” Adelson said. “It can range anywhere from disability services to transportation to first generation students and the resources that they can access to undocumented students and how they’re affected in our community, and a lot more.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Adelson’s platform he intended to align East Campus and West Campus library hours as best as possible, which he was able to accomplish. At <a href="http://sbstatesman.com/2014/05/15/campus-briefing-usg-cracks-down-on-professors-and-course-syllabi/" target="_blank">its May 14, 2014 meeting</a>, the USG senate passed a resolution to request that the university align library hours at the Health Sciences Library and Melville Library in a 19-0-1 vote.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Adelson also had plans to expand USG’s PASS tutoring program, but because <a href="http://sbstatesman.com/2013/10/29/new-tutoring-center-opening-on-campus/" target="_blank">the university established its own tutoring program</a>, PASS was dissolved.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stony Brook University’s Center for Biotechnology plans to establish a research hub after winning a $3 million award from the National Institutes of Health. The hub will be a joint effort between Stony Brook University, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and Brookhaven National Laboratory to turn biomedical discoveries into commercial products that help to better the health and care of patients. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stony Brook University’s Long Island Bioscience Hub will be “designed to identify promising basic science and invest in the development of that idea towards [sic] applied goals to demonstrate feasibility of ideas to improve health and society,” Stony Brook University’s Clinton Rubin, Ph.D., the principal investigator for this project, said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rubin is also a SUNY distinguished professor and chair of the Department of Biomedical Engineering<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>as well as director of the Center for Biotechnology.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Center for Biotechnology’s mission is “to develop bioscience innovations into next-generation biomedical products, facilitate new company formation and expansion, and support the overall growth of the bioscience industry in New York State through specific programmatic offerings and the development of bioscience-specific business infrastructure,” according to <a href="http://centerforbiotechnology.org/" target="_blank">the center’s website</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The NIH-REACH [Research Evaluation and Commercialization Hub] will “provide qualified institutions with the initial investment and resources to nurture innovators to develop high priority early-stage technologies,” according to the NIH website.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The NIH-REACH program requires technology development, intellectual property, licensing and commercialization,” Rubin said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The competition was nationwide, but only three universities were granted the award. The other awarded universities that received grants were the University of Louisville and the University of Minnesota. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The application process for a grant from the NIH takes about 10 months. Rubin described the process as “brutal.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Applicants must be a university or other research institution, according to the NIH website. The NIH only accepts one application per institution.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nearly 100 universities applied for this grant, Rubin said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The review panel must have recognized the great potential of commercializing biomedical technologies from Stony Brook University, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and Brookhaven National Laboratory,” Rubin said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stony Brook University will receive $1 million per year for three years. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The NIH requires each hub to provide appropriate funding, resources and expertise required for early-stage technology, as well as skills development, hands-on experience, educational and networking activities. It is also assumed that once an institution becomes granted an award, it will become self-sustaining.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rubin said this journey has been “a great partnership with the Stony Brook University faculty, the Office of Tech Transfer, the VP for Research, and the VP for Economic Development.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_39258" align="alignleft" width="600"]<a href="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/150416_USG-senate-_Manju.Shivacharan_2305.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-39258" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/150416_USG-senate-_Manju.Shivacharan_2305.jpg" alt="Current USG President, Gary Lachar, above, said about $176,000 in unallocated funds would be added per year with the fee increase.

<p class="p1">Along with potential candidates, students will have an important issue to vote in during this year’s Undergraduate Student Government elections—a possible increase of the Student Activity Fee.</p>
<p class="p1">By a vote of 16-3-0, the USG senate approved a referendum on the fee on Thursday, April 16. President Garry Lachhar said after a month-long discussion by the Executive Council, its resolution was aimed “to help increase campus life.”</p>
<p class="p1">The current fee is set at $99.50 per semester, and it was last increased by $5 in 2013. This referendum is looking for an increase of $5.50 per semester, bringing the total fee per semester to $105, with the year total still below the maximum amount of $250.</p>
<p class="p1">“An increase is definitely not needed,” Treasurer Kathryn Michaud said, “but if students want to be able to have those extras, those ‘want’ items, we’re going to need to have more money to fund those.”</p>
<p class="p1">Should students vote for the referendum come elections time, Lachhar said about $176,000 in unallocated funds would be added per year with the fee increase. Lachhar also stressed the importance of promoting this issue, especially by those not running for office next year.</p>
<p class="p1">“This is for the growth of not just this organization but every club on campus,” Lachhar said. “Of course you can’t guarantee that it will go to the clubs, but as a whole, our organization will grow from this increase, but only if people vote for it.”</p>
<p class="p1">Vice President of Academic Affairs Steven Adelson also presented the 2015 USG Constitution Act, which had been put on hold for some time due to budget discussions, and was approved unanimously, 20-0-0. Though many minor suggestions were added, two key points were the academic standing of USG members and office hours.</p>
<p class="p1">“We believe that whether or not you stay in USG based on your academics should not be decided by a fellow student, because they don’t necessarily have that best interest at heart,” Adelson said. “What the recommendation is, is that if you fall below the minimum cumulative GPA requirement to be in USG, you are automatically dismissed.”</p>
<p class="p1">Though this is similar to the previous wording in the constitution, Adelson said it is important to add “cumulative” in the laws because “if you have a good GPA but have one really bad semester, you can still be in USG.”</p>
<p class="p1">The GPA requirements for the entire Executive Council were leveled out to 2.5. The current requirement for a senator is 2.5 and 2.75 for a justice. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></p>
<p class="p1">Adelson also wanted to address the ambiguity of “office hours” for the Executive Council and senate, since he said he completes a lot of his duties and responsibilities outside the office.</p>
<p class="p1">“For me in particular, there’s not a lot for me to do at the office,” he said. “So I felt it appropriate to leave it up to the administration to decide whether or not what you’re doing is conducive to your duties and responsibilities rather than the constitution saying you have to be in the office half the time no matter what.”</p>
<p class="p1">The Black Womyn’s Association had its budget readjusted after its appeal for more money to host its Emerald City Festival was approved 19-0-0. The association’s president, senior biology major Bianca Boafo, outlined the efforts her club went through to earn back the trust of the senate after <a href="http://sbstatesman.com/2015/02/17/campus-briefing-nine-clubs-lose-budgets-after-usg-senate-passes-appropriations-act/" target="_blank">the Appropriations Act passed on Feb. 12</a> had cost them their funding. College of Arts and Sciences Sen. Marissa Peterson said she would like to see these kinds of efforts from clubs rewarded.</p>
<p class="p1">“I feel like they seem really confident and they’ve put a lot of work into this so far, and I think that this semester was a big lesson,” Peterson said. “You guys had to really work hard to get the budget back, so I think it’s going to work out.”</p>
<p class="p1">One new club officially recognized by USG was the Alliance Française. The group’s president, sophomore political science and French double major Elizabeth Morgan, said the group was a necessary forum for students of French background or those learning the language.</p>
<p class="p1">“This club is important in terms of keeping the cultural atmosphere of the French department alive,” Morgan said. “It’s a small club, but we’re trying to grow, and it’s a great way to bring more diversity to campus.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

EFAL SAYED / THE STATESMAN" width="600" height="400" /></a> Junior Jane Sallen (above, No. 25) allowed three hits in each of her starts against Maine. <em>EFAL SAYED / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Stony Brook softball team entered the weekend with a crucial three-game series against the Maine Black Bears, splitting the doubleheader on Saturday before taking Sunday’s grudge match. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Seawolves started out their doubleheader with a 4-2 loss to end their six-game win streak. Stony Brook’s Jane Sallen and Maine’s Alexis Bogdanovich both pitched complete games, allowing only three hits each.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Black Bears scored two of their four runs in the bottom of the first inning, when EmJ Fogel hit a triple, scoring Felicia Lennon and Rachel Carlson. Through the first inning, Sallen had given up two runs on one hit. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The top of the second went quickly as Stony Brook failed to get a hit. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Maine continued in its stride as the Black Bears plated two without registering a hit in the second inning. With two outs, Lexie Shue made a fielding error at shortstop, allowing two runs to score and giving the Black Bears a 4-0 lead.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stony Brook answered with two runs in the top of the fourth to cut the deficit in half. With one out and the bases empty, Bria Green came to the plate, and she did what she does best: hit home runs. She smacked her 16th homer of the season to left field, two more than the entire Maine roster combined.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Up next was Shayla Giosia, and she brought some jolt of her own to the offense, hitting her ninth home run of the year. The back-to-back blasts were not enough to get the Seawolves going, as Maine retired 11 of the next 12 batters.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sallen was given the loss, dropping her record to 12-8. Through six innings of work, she walked two batters and struck out two. Bogdanovich also had an impressive outing. She did not walk a single batter and had 12 strikeouts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Allison Cukrov picked up her seventh win and fourth shutout of the year when Stony Brook won the second game of the doubleheader, 4-0. She only gave up three hits while fanning six Black Bears.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Seawolves got their first lead of the series in the top of the first inning, when Giosia hit an RBI single, driving Chelsea Evans home. The offense would stay quiet until the sixth when it came to life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With Erin Bogdanovich pitching and Kellie Reynolds on first, Melissa Phelan slapped a single to center field. With two outs, Shue came to the plate and blasted a three-run home run to left field, her fifth, to give SBU a 4-0 lead. Cukrov was able to retire the next six batters in order to secure the win.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In addition to the powerful hitting and dominant pitching, the Seawolves were defensively flawless in game two. After committing two errors in the series opener, the fielding improved and did not make a single error. Stony Brook has had the second-fewest errors in the America East this season with 27, just two behind Maine.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Seawolves made a very late comeback in the rubber match of the series to win 2-1. Cukrov pitched 7.1 innings without allowing a run and was able to close out the win.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Black Bears took their only lead of the game in the bottom of the second, when Nikki Byron singled to right, scoring Fogel. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stony Brook’s offense was shut down for most of the game. The Seawolves did have a few opportunities to score early, but they could not capitalize. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Seawolves finally got on the board in the top of the sixth inning, when Lauren Kamachi hit a two-out solo home run, tying the game. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Seawolves took the lead in the ninth, with two outs. Evans hit a single to center field, her only hit of the ball game.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Green came up next, and she was able to hit a double to send Evans home, giving SBU a 2-1 lead.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>Point 1: Stony Brook Baseball is getting hot, and that is scary for the rest of the America East conference.</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Not only is Matt Senk’s Stony Brook baseball squad taking down teams outside of its conference (see the comeback win against LIU Brooklyn and two wins against the Big East’s Georgetown Hoyas), but the Seawolves are also getting hot within the America East.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This team, which had a bunch of questions coming into the season, is developing back into a perennial conference power. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Need proof? Jack Parenty is hitting at a scorching .364 pace this season, which ranks in the top 70 nationally. </span>Andruw Gazzola and Jeremy Giles are also swinging hot bats, hitting safely in eight straight games.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The pitching void left by Brandon McNitt and Frankie Vanderka has been immediately filled by Daniel Zamora and a combination of Ryley MacEachern and Nicholas DiEva. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">There is also Tyler Honahan, who is pitching with a 5-2 record with a 3.14 ERA and striking out 46 batters. </span>He has also allowed only four runs in his past three starts, hitting his stride right as May comes around.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It may not be 2012’s version, but this team is gelling at the right time, as the possibility of a Cinderella slipper in the NCAA’s is in full view. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><i>-By Cameron Boon, Assistant Sports Editor</i></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b><i>Point 2: Bria Green is staying hot for, and chasing records for Stony Brook Softball.</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you pitch to Bria Green, you are going to have a bad time.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">That is what Fairfield discovered on Wednesday when it opted to pitch to the senior outfielder with a runner on and two outs in the bottom of the seventh of a tie game. Rather than intentionally walking the red-hot Seawolves slugger, Fairfield chose to pitch to her, leaving the door open for her to do major offensive damage.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And she did just that. With the game on the line, Green hit a moonshot deep over the centerfield wall to win the game for Stony Brook, as her teammates greeted her at home plate in a state of jubilation.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This is a teachable moment for opposing pitchers, as it represents a perfect example of what not to do when Green comes up with runners in scoring position. Many, including Seawolves coach Megan Bryant, were surprised that Green would even get an opportunity to face live pitching with the game on the line. Opposing pitchers should learn from this costly Fairfield mistake. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Green is in the midst of perhaps the best offensive season in Stony Brook softball history. She is currently batting .452 with 15 home runs and 40 RBI in 30 games. With just three more home runs and 11 more RBI, Green will become Stony Brook’s all-time single-season leader in both categories, which would be the icing on the cake of a dominant season.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><i>-By Chris Gaine, Staff Writer</i></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b><i>Point 3: Stony Brook men’s lacrosse will have two All-Americans.</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Last year, there were 42 Division-I men’s lacrosse All-Americans and another 51 honorable mentions. None of them wore a Stony Brook uniform.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">At the pace senior midfielder Mike Rooney and junior attack Brody Eastwood are playing, this is bound to change in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In Wednesday’s loss to Duke, Rooney tied a school record for most points in a season, reaching the 82 mark with three goals and two assists, and then broke it against Binghamton Sunday with a nine-point outing.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He is currently the nation’s point leader and sits at third in points per game with 5.86, behind Albany’s Lyle Thompson and Brown’s Dylan Molloy. Rooney also leads the country in assists, as he is tied with Thompson with 46.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Eastwood has a knack for finding the back of the net. In Stony Brook’s 20-9 shelling against UMass Lowell, he recorded ten goals, which proved to be more than the entire opposition.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Eastwood, like Rooney, is also a Division I leader, as he has buried the most goals on the season, 53, and is second behind Molloy in goals per game, at 3.79. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Maybe Eastwood’s most impressive quality is his efficiency. He holds, by far, the highest shot percentage in the country at .631 percent. The runner-up, Boston University’s Adam Schaal, has shot .568 percent and has taken half of the attempts. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">-<i>By Chris Peraino, Staff Writer</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><b><i>Point 4: Kylie Ohlmiller is an offensive catalyst for Stony Brook women’s lacrosse</i></b></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In any sport, there is only so much you can realistically expect out of a college freshman. The typical freshman is usually hesitant and turnover-prone. Kylie Ohlmiller defies conventional wisdom.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The 5-3 Islip product leads the Seawolves in points (59) and assists (27) this season, and trails only Courtney Murphy in goals on the team (32). </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Perhaps the most impressive<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>thing about Ohlmiller’s game is her vision offensively. Usually stationed at the side of the net to the opposing goaltender’s left, Ohlmiller, being a left-handed shot, has the angles needed to either shoot the ball or set up a teammate (most often Murphy) cutting towards the net. She makes decisive plays before the opposing defense can even react, and has the wisdom not to force the ball when the lanes are not available to shoot or pass. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The emergence of Ohlmiller as a superstar has been crucial in the No. 6 Seawolves’ outstanding season. Everyone knew that Head Coach Joe Spallina’s defense would be among the nation’s best, but Ohlmiller’s play at the offensive end has helped elevate this team to the national contenders they are now considered to be.</span></p>

CAM BOON / THE STATESMAN" width="600" height="400" /></a> Senior Cole Peragine (above, No. 28) scored the winning run of game two on Saturday. <em>CAMERON BOON / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stony Brook’s baseball team won its ninth straight game en route to taking both games in Saturday’s doubleheader with the Georgetown Hoyas 4-1 and 3-2, but fell behind early on Sunday and could not finish off the sweep, losing 10-1.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the opening game, the Hoyas got on the board in the top of the first, senior second baseman Robert Chavarria led off the second with a single to right field. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Three batters later, a single up the middle by freshman Andruw Gazzola tied the game at one. </span>From here on out, it was a pitching duel.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After the first, junior lefty Tyler Honahan would throw five scoreless innings, striking out five batters and walking two. </span>Honahan has only allowed five runs in his past five outings.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Seawolves would go on to break the game open in the ninth and final inning. </span>Sophomore shortstop Jeremy Giles set the pace with a lead-off single and would later come around to score off a Toby Handley single.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Senior catcher Cole Peragine would take first after being hit by a pitch. </span>Two batters later, Chavarria would knock both Handley and Peragine in on a single to right.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sophomore Cameron Stone went on to throw his third scoreless inning and record one of his three strikeouts to end the game, earning him his first win of the 2015 season.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the second game, Georgetown would again score first, posting a run in the first inning, but the Seawolves would again answer in the second. </span>In similar fashion, Chavarria would start the inning with a single, but would get picked off during the ensuing bat.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Back-to-back singles by Gazzola and utility man, sophomore Casey Baker, put runners at the corners with one out. </span>Gazzola extended his hitting streak to eight games after recording a hit on Sunday. He then scored on a fielding error by Georgetown’s second baseman and Baker would trot into third base.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Giles knocked Baker home on a sacrifice fly to center, making the score 3-1 Stony Brook. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Hoyas looked to chip at the lead in fourth, as they scored one run on four hits and a Stony Brook error, putting them within one of the lead. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Peragine began the fifth with a double down the right field line.</span>Handley would single in the next at-bat, and Peragine would score off of another error by Georgetown’s second baseman.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sophomore left-hander Daniel Zamora started the game, giving up one earned run, striking out one and walking three in 3.1 innings of work. </span>Junior Chad Lee received the win after coming in for relief to post 2.2 scoreless innings.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Freshman lefty Teddy Rodliff notched his fourth save of the year, striking out two in the seventh without giving up a hit or walking a batter.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The third matchup was all Georgetown, preventing the Seawolves from securing the sweep. </span>For the third straight game, the Hoyas knocked in one run in the first inning, but this time, Georgetown found offense in later innings as well.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sophomore Ryley MacEachern started the game for the Seawolves and struggled, lasting four innings and giving up four runs on six hits while striking out two batters and walking a pair.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the second inning , Georgetown shortstop Ryan Busch hit a two-run home run to left field, making the score 3-1 Hoyas. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">MacEachern would later give up back-to-back extra-base hits to Busch and right fielder substitute Joseph Bialkowski in the fourth, stretching the Georgetown lead to three runs at 4-1.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Junior Tim Knesnik came in for relief in the fifth and was shelled for five runs on six hits, while only recording one out. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After giving up a single, Knesnik gave up a two-run home run coming from the hands of AC Carter. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Busch would continue his impressive afternoon with a double and would later score on a wild pitch to add to the five-run Hoya inning that extended their lead to 9-1, all but putting the game out of reach for the Seawolves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Hoyas tacked on another run in the seventh, as Bush homered to left-center. </span>He would go 4-for-4 with two homers and two doubles.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Seawolves only run came via Peragine, who found his way around the bases after reaching off an error by Georgetown second baseman Charlie Dillon. </span>He scored off of a Chavarria ground out to the pitcher, the second baseman’s second RBI of the weekend series.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stony Brook travels to New Britain to play a one game series against Central Connecticut on Wednesday afternoon. </span>Afterwards, the crew heads to Albany to play an America East Conference three-game series Saturday and Sunday to cap off its road trip.</p>]]></content:encoded>

MANJU SHIVACHARAN / THE STATESMAN[/caption]
<p class="p1">On Sunday afternoon, the Stony Brook’s men’s lacrosse team came back from a 10-4 second-half deficit to defeat Binghamton, 14-13, with a winning goal in overtime.</p>
<p class="p1">Junior midfielder Challen Rogers scored the winning goal with 50 seconds left in overtime with an assist from senior attackman Mike Rooney after Binghamton lost possession for being offsides.</p>
<p class="p1">“We always practice getting up field, getting up field, so we busted it and we swung it down to me at ‘x’ and then I think someone caught it and then Challen came almost over the top and curled in so I just hit him. He just took it and buried it, it’s a big goal,” Rooney said.</p>
<p class="p1">Rooney totaled nine points in the game, breaking the career and season records for points scored by a Stony Brook player, scoring two goals and dishing seven assists.</p>
<p class="p1">“I didn’t even know, that’s great,” Rooney said.</p>
<p class="p1">Kevin Crowley, who played from 2008-2011, previously held the career record with 232 points.</p>
<p class="p1">“Kevin was a great player. I played with him one year, it was awesome,” Rooney said. “It’s nice to get that, worked hard, but just focused on the next game.”</p>
<p class="p1">“I think he has just had such a great year,” Head Coach Jim Nagle said. “Just watching his maturation process has been great to see, really happy for him.”</p>
<p class="p1">The Seawolves had a rough start in the first quarter, as Binghamton took a 4-1 lead. In the second quarter, Binghamton maintained its lead, as the Bearcats scored another four goals while Stony Brook only tallied three, making it 8-4 Bearcats at the half.</p>
<p class="p1">“I thought we had our worst half of the year,” Nagle said. “They came out and they were ready to play, but outworked us, which typically hadn’t happened all year to this team.”</p>
<p class="p1">Stony Brook was down 8-4 at halftime, and Binghamton scored two more goals in the beginning of the third quarter, giving the Bearcats a six-goal lead. Stony Brook responded strongly with a change in momentum, scoring the next six goals in the game and tying it at 10-10.</p>
<p class="p1">“I think we brought our energy up a little bit,” Rooney said.</p>
<p class="p1">The game went back and forth in the fourth quarter and it was tied at 13-13 for the start of the extra period. The overtime goal by Rogers won Stony Brook the game and clinched its spot in the America East Conference Tournament. This is the 14th straight year the Seawolves will participate in the conference tournament.</p>
<p class="p1">Junior attackman Brody Eastwood scored a game-high five goals, while freshman attackman Jake Sheets scored two goals and added an assist on the afternoon. Sophomore midfielder Ryan Bitzer and freshman midfielder McLean Chicquen each put a ball in the net.</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s a big win, obviously it goes into overtime, you want to win the games,” Rooney said. “We’ve lost a lot of close games the past few years so it’s good to get one our way.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Just real proud of the way they fought back and the poise that Mike Rooney had at the end of that game was really something we hadn’t had from anybody since I’ve been here,” Nagle said.</p>
<p class="p1">The Seawolves go on to play Hartford on Friday, April 24. The Seawolves can secure the second seed with a win against the same team.</p>
<p class="p1">“We finally get a week to practice a lot,” Rooney said. “It’s been a tough stretch for us, but we get to get back to our fundamentals and stuff in practice.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1">Kylie Ohlmiller and Courtney Murphy led the way once again for the No. 6 Seawolves offensively as Stony Brook women’s lacrosse routed UMBC 13-7 in Baltimore on Friday night.</p>
<p class="p1">The win against the Retrievers improves the Seawolves’ record to 14-1 on the season and 5-0 in America East conference play. With the win, Stony Brook locked up home-field advantage for the upcoming conference tournament. For the third consecutive year, for a team to dethrone the Seawolves, it will need to defeat them at Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium.</p>
<p class="p1">Ohlmiller had five points in the contest via a pair of goals and three assists. Murphy scored four goals to bring her seasonal goal total to 50. She joins Demmianne Cook as the only Seawolves attackers to ever reach the 50-goal plateau on multiple occasions.</p>
<p class="p1">Taylor Ranftle and Dorrien Van Dyke each had two goals and two assists as well in the match. Amber Kupres scored two goals and had an assist. It was the first time this season the Seawolves have had five players score multiple goals. Stony Brook has scored ten or more goals in nine of its last 11 games as the offense seems to be clicking better as the season goes along.</p>
<p class="p1">The 13-7 final score deceives the true dominance the Seawolves imposed in the match. Stony Brook scored the first five goals of the game to lead 5-0 after 15:36 in the first half, asserting its will on an outmatched Retriever defense.</p>
<p class="p1">They led by as much as 10-2 after a goal 2:15 into the second half.</p>
<p class="p1">The advantage could have been even greater had it not been for stellar play by Kelsey Major, the Retrievers keeper.</p>
<p class="p1">Major had eight saves in the match, including a couple of key stops on Murphy that could have allowed the Seawolves attacker to have even a more spectacular game than she ended up with.</p>
<p class="p1">Stony Brook dominated on the draws Friday night, winning 14 of 22 faceoffs, something Head Coach Joe Spallina has emphasized throughout the season.</p>
<p class="p1">It is an aspect of the game the team has greatly improved; the Seawolves won 47 percent of their draws in the first six games of the season, and have won 56 percent since then.</p>
<p class="p1">Stony Brook’s next game is on the road against their Long Island rival, Hofstra, for a 7 p.m. matchup on Tuesday night.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Men's lacrosse midfielder Mike Rooney and softball pitcher Allison Cukrov were named Players of the Week by the America East on Monday afternoon.

Rooney has been racking up awards this season. He has now been named Player of the Week of the conference four times, an impressive feat considering that it is also the conference in which Lyle Thompson, the all-time NCAA leading scorer, plays.

As Stony Brook prepares for the upcoming conference tournament, Rooney has been spectacular. In two home games last week against Duke and Binghamton, the East Islip native totalled five goals and nine assists.

Rooney’s final point of the week came on an overtime assist on a game-winning goal by Challen Rogers to topple the visiting Bearcats, 14-13, on Sunday. With this assist, Rooney became the all-time leading scorer in Seawolves men’s lacrosse history with 233 points, passing 2011 graduate Kevin Crowley.

In the game with Binghamton, Rooney tallied two goals and seven assists, his third nine point game of the season. Seven of his nine points came in the second half, as the Seawolves erased a 10-4 deficit. Against Duke on Tuesday, he scored three goals and two assists.

Rooney leads the country this season with 91 points and 53 assists, both school records, breaking former records held by John Warrack in 1984 and John Sproat in 1990. With nine or more points in the rest of the season, Rooney will become the fifth player in America East history to score 100 points in the season.

The Seawolves will be back in action on Friday for a road game against the Hartford Hawks before the America East tournament begins the following weekend.

For the twelfth time in her illustrious softball career, Stony Brook senior pitcher Allison Cukrov has taken home America East Player of the Week honors.

In three appearances last week, Cukrov went 3-0 with a 0.66 ERA, striking out 18 batters in 21.1 innings. This was a driving force behind Stony Brook’s successful week, as the Seawolves won five of their six games played.

Curkov, the reigning America East Pitcher of the Year, has pitched drastically better in recent games than she had early in the season. Earlier this month, her ERA had ballooned to over 5.00 at its worst point. She hardly looked like the ace pitcher she had been in 2014.

But with her success in recent games, she has gotten her ERA down almost two full runs to a respectable 3.24. Cukrov’s eight wins are good for second on the team and with just six more, she would become Stony Brook’s career leader in the category.

The resurgent Cukrov has provided the Seawolves with two dominant starting pitchers at the top of their rotation. Fellow Stony Brook pitcher Jane Sallen has also pitched well this season, as she has gone 12-8 with a 2.36 ERA.

If Cukrov can continue to pitch like she did last week, it would do volumes for the Seawolves’ postseason hopes. The team is currently tied for first in the America East with a 7-2 conference record. With seven conference games to go, the revitalization of Cukrov can only help Stony Brook going forward.

Jazz nights are held every Wednesday from 8 to 11 p.m. in the University Café, located between the Union and the Recreation Center. Undergraduate and graduate students of the university perform jazz music. Students 21 and over are welcome to come relax, have a drink, do some homework or hang out with friends.

“I just want to get acts that appeal to our age group,” Nicholas J. Bechtel, the Graduate Student Organization production director in charge of booking bands for jazz night, said. “I feel like college is a time to experiment with music and learn about new things and see artists that may not be ones ideal genre, but to be captivated by something new and interesting.”

GSO is the working government of the graduate student program for Stony Brook. Bechtel works alongside Mary Garvey, the media specialist for GSO, to try and spread the word to graduate and of-age undergraduate students of events, like jazz night, that are offered by GSO.

“GSO is so small that all it takes is Nick to pick the band and me to organize it,” Garvey said. “USG has to take care of a lot more kids and it takes a lot  more to put a concert together because its so big.”

The café itself is very relaxed, especially on Wednesdays to try and set the mood for jazzy music. Tables  are scattered all around the café, with the bar in the back and stage toward the front. Blue overhead lighting fills the entire bar, with colorful lights set up on the café stage where the jazz performances are held.

Last Wednesday, April 18, student jazz band, Kickback Trio, played for the first hour and a half on stage. After performing, the band took a break and invited students to go on stage and play music with them for the last hour of the night. Some students hopped on stage to sing, others came prepared with instruments to come on stage.

The Kickback Trio has been headlining the jazz nights for the past three years.

The band is made of three members: Chris Howard on the drums, Keenan Zach on the bass and Lluis Capdevilla on the piano. All players are in the graduate program at the university and are planning to continue playing at jazz nights.

Capdevilla said Kickback Trio performs at other venues outside of Stony Brook and has structured practices, but while on stage at jazz nights, almost everything performed is improvised.

“I like to play jazz because of the freedom it has with playing,” Capdevilla said. “Nowadays music is very structured, but when we are performing, yes, we know the frame, we know the melody and we know the harmony, but we are improvising on stage.”

Bands like Kickback Trio used to pull in hundreds of students each Wednesday night, but over the years, jazz night lost its spark on campus.

Bechtel said he has been working with Garvey to try and get jazz nights back to being the “popular spot on campus it used to be.”

Bechtel said when he was a freshman and came to his first event at UCafé, there were 300 people there.

“People were bursting out of the doors. And when I saw this band and I loved them, and I’ve been here ever since,” he said.

Student attendance depends several factors, like weather, when midterms are and other events that might be happening on campus that night.

“Sometimes the café is so packed with people I can not move,” Garvey said. “Sometimes there’s just ten to fifteen people. It depends on a lot of things.”

While some nights are more packed than others, jazz night continues to successfully offer students a way to learn about, what is usually considered an off-the-beaten path music genre.

“I love coming here and listening to the performances,” said Robyn Quinnett, a first-year graduate student, said. “That’s a thing about listening to this kind of music. You’ll either feel something or you don’t, simple as that.”]]></content:encoded>

“Mysterious Lake” provides a unique and immersive theater experience, melding dialogue, dance, chant, fog, shadow and striking puppetry to draw the audience into its world.

Izumi Ashizawa created and directed the play.

Ashizawa is a theater professor at Stony Brook University. Stony Brook’s Theater Arts Department is showing the play, which features both members of the Izumi Ashizawa Performance Company and Stony Brook University students. The first performance was on April 16 in Theater 1 of the Staller Center.

The audience stood in a serpentine line outside the theater doors. When the doors opened they  were not greeted by ushers or theater seating, but led by a guide in a white and red robe, a traditional Japanese Shinto Miko costume, through the theater doors and down a winding path of red gates.

The rest of the theater was dark. It was like walking down the exquisite gullet of some great beast. At the end of the path was a square cloth structure reminiscent of a shrine or temple.

During the performance shadows were projected up on the fabric walls to simulate a forest.

Fog rolled out across the stage, drums and chanting wrapped around the audience. Surreal, dreamlike scenes floated by viewers during the prologue.

The play begins with an American boy, Daniel, who moved to Japan with his father. Sent out on a simple errand, he stumbles upon a secret world lying behind the reality of his own.

He is drawn into this world after an encounter with a mythical water creature, a kappa, which results in them fusing and sharing the same body and mind.

As Daniel wanders through this fantastical reality he meets foreign beings: Japanese Yokai, or spirits of nature.

The spirits he meets are being starved of water. The lake that supplies their water has been dried up for a long time because Nushi-sama, a dragon who is the creatures’ guardian and the source of the lake’s water, has been missing for over seven years.

In order to return to his world and his original form, Daniel must set out on a quest in order to find the lake’s guardian.

He learns that human action in his world affects this secret one. The human’s polluted water corrupts the secret world. The falling trees in his world have drained the lake’s dragon of her power. Daniel’s quest turns toward both finding the dragon and stopping the damage to the world of the mysterious lake.

The play is performed by actor-puppeteers, dressed in black, manipulating an array of life-size, exotic figures.

It is a little strange at first to see people clearly moving behind and working together to manipulate the puppets, but the effect worked because no attempt is made to conceal the performers.

Their movement of the puppets becomes a sort of dance in and of itself because of the grace with which they do it. The puppets themselves hold up well under scrutiny. They are detailed and ornate.

The play explores themes of duality and unity, not through words but through the characters and reality of the play—America and Japan, modern Japan and the ancient world of the forest.

Daniel and the kappa meld into one body, unified; but they will be destroyed if they are not able to separate again—just as Daniel’s reality and the reality of the lake may destroy each other.

Daniel may come away in the end with just enough perception of nature to begin to change the world and the play gives the audience new perception, as well as a good theater should.

The play’s one weakness is the dialogue, which seems overly explanatory at times—the messages of environmentalism and conservation are made almost too clear.

But this is also somewhat of a necessity, as the play is meant to appeal to and educate children as well as adults.

The dragon itself, being life-sized, presents a technical difficulty. The body is somewhat abstract compared to the rest of the puppets, but on the whole it is handled excellently and the head is detailed and fascinating to examine and watch move.

The puppets are unique and something very different from the smaller, puppet-theater-box type puppets one may be familiar with from childhood.

The use of these figures—the boy Daniel, the kappa, the woodland spirits and the dragon—to convey the story has several advantages. It gives the audience something interesting to look at.

By using the puppets instead of real people, it reminds the audience of the symbolic and mythical aspects of the play.

It also helps to reinforce that the play takes place in a different world. The creatures that enter the secret world are different and the adults of the “real” world are represented only by shadows projected on the fabric walls from without.

The movements and dancing of the performers is precise and graceful. Additionally, the fabric walls of the theater, where the audience sits, allow scenes to be played out with shadows projected on the cloth walls. Shadow trees roll in the wind and tumble under chainsaws.

The music and sound, which surround the audience from all sides thanks to the placement of the seating on the stage, is the most wonderful part.

It is what brings the audience into and out of this magically real place.

The chants and folk songs, in addition to the sounds of a Taiko drum, built a whole aural world around the audience and seem to vibrate through you and shift you as you take them in.

The different elements of the play come together well to present a clear set of themes and a unified view of a world.

The Staller Center will hold three more performances of “Mysterious Lake” from Wednesday, April 22 to Friday, April 24.]]></content:encoded>

Gone are the days when Stony Brook University had Marijuana Festivals. According to a previous article published by <i>The Statesman</i> in April 1975, one occurred; students gathered in Roth Quad and drank and smoked without facing punishment. The festival was part of Tabler Springfest, a two-day event, according to the article.

While Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a limited medical marijuana bill on July 5, 2014, recreational use of marijuana is still not permitted in New York State. According to Norml: Working to Reform Marijuana Laws’ website, anyone caught with 25 grams to two ounces of marijuana may face a three-month incarceration period and a maximum fine of $250 according to the site.

According to an article on PBS’s “Frontline,” the government encouraged the production of hemp in 1890s. Hemp is the commercial use of the plant’s stalk and seeds to produce textiles, food, paper and so forth. In fact, in 1619, farmers were required to grow hemp.

It was not until 1900 to 1920 when Mexican immigrants came to the United States that the recreational use of marijuana was introduced, according to PBS’ “Frontline” article. During the Great Depression, the fear associated with these immigrants transferred over to how marijuana was perceived by the society. The government became concerned with the recreational use of marijuana, which prompted research into it. They linked its use with violence and crime committed by “racially inferior” individuals.

There are several myths expanding upon the negative perception of marijuana. One myth published by the PBS’ “Frontline” article details journalist William Randolph Hearst’s involvement in the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937. The Act put a tax on cannabis, hemp and marijuana, according to USLegal’s site. The theory is that Hearst had paper plantations and hemp threatened such a business, as it could have replaced the use of trees for the production of paper.

<em><strong>Correction: April 26, 2015</strong></em>

<em>An earlier version of this article referred to Stony Brook students as "Seawolves." However, in 1975  Stony Brook students were called "Patriots." The story has been updated to reflect this. </em>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Streetlight Manifesto finally makes it to the Brook</title>

“Thank you Streetlight, thank you Streetlight,” the crowd chanted after Streetlight Manifesto performed its encore. The band performed on Monday, April 20 after a long-awaited appearance on campus after the initial show was cancelled back in January.

USG sold about 400 tickets to the show and those who came out to party did not hold back. Ska-lovers from all corners of campus came out to enjoy the music and celebrate 4/20.

The room was filled with sweaty college students forming circle pits all night to the upbeat tunes. For some, the concert being canceled a first time actually worked in their favor. Many students who did not know about the concert initially were now able to get a ticket for this April performance.

The concert was originally going to be held Jan. 29, but due to an issue with a contract, USG canceled the concert with the promise of rescheduling.

Mike Millus, a sophomore political science major said that he was happy the concert was canceled the first time because it was only after the cancellation that he heard about the concert.

“I think that they were on point,” he said. “This is the best I have ever seen them play.” Millus had seen the band play five times prior to this show. He called the concert the “ultimate blend of ska music and alternative music at Stony Brook University.”

It seemed to be a trend that many of the students in attendance of the show have been fans of the band for years and have seen them play a few times before.

The student band who opened the show, Nice Shot, Kid, said that Streetlight Manifesto is a major inspiration of theirs and that the members listened to them all throughout high school.

“To share a stage with them [Streetlight Manifesto] was just mind-blowing,” AJ Ka-e, the drummer of Nice Shot, Kid, said.

To fit in with the ska-theme for the night, Nice Shot, Kid had two students come on stage and perform a song with them. Two horn players— Shane Gallimore, a freshman biology major and Dylan Schreiber, a sophomore civil engineering major—covered the song “Superman” by Goldfinger with the band.

The smaller venue allowed for a more interactive experience between the band and the students. Mike Brown, Streetlight’s baritone and alto saxophone player, pointed and made faces at the students who were jumping up and singing along.

The crowd wanted more after the band finished its set and left the stage the first time. After chanting for more songs the chant somehow turned into a “USA” chant.

When Streetlight returned to the stage for its encore, one of the band members, playing off the audiences’ joke, said “we are USA” into the mic.

The band encored with the songs “The Big Sleep” and “Somewhere in the Between.” The audience brought the energy for the last two songs of the night and formed a circle pit that took up most of the floor space.

“Best 4/20 of my life and that was my fifth time seeing them,” Abi Lopez, a sophomore business and women’s studies major, said. “Stony Brook did something right for once,” Lopez said about the fact that the concert got rescheduled.

Despite the aroma of cannabis floating through the air in honor of the “holiday,” the crowd was in control. There were a few students who attempted crowd surfing and others who went up onto shoulders, but these efforts were quickly put to rest by the tight security. Students came out to have a good time and enjoy the music, and the concert ran smoothly.

<p class="p1">Senior short-distance runner and long jumper Lamar Hayes is nearing the finish line of his Division I career. After four years of placing in a number of races and overcoming an injury, Hayes came back to finish his long and successful run at Stony Brook.</p>
<p class="p1">The 22-year-old from Voorhees, New Jersey, comes from a major basketball family. His mother Lateefah and his father Leonard played basketball at Saint Peter’s College. His older brother Lenny played for the Stony Brook basketball team and graduated in 2013. His younger brother Lewis plays football and basketball at Williams College in Massachusetts.</p>
<p class="p1">Hayes decided to take a different route. He played soccer and basketball throughout high school until he broke his ankle in October of his senior year. At that point, he decided to take a different course by going after track and field.</p>
<p class="p1">Hayes broke his foot twice playing his family's pastime. Hayes later suffered a stress fracture in his foot during his sophomore year of college and broke it again last year. He took a medical redshirt his junior year, which allowed Hayes to continue running for Stony Brook for one more year.</p>
<p class="p1">With a permanent screw in his foot, he was ready to compete during the winter season.</p>
<p class="p1">Hayes dominated the Fordham Christmas Classic, winning the 60-meter dash and long jump.</p>
<p class="p1">He placed third in the 200-meter dash finals in the America East Indoor Championship, and won the 300-meter dash in 26.24 seconds at Stony Brook’s Quad Meet.</p>
<p class="p1">Long distances are not Hayes’ cup of tea. He said if his coach asked him to run a mile, it would take him quite a while.</p>
<p class="p1">“Nobody looks forward to running,” Hayes said. “But during the race everyone loves racing.”</p>
<p class="p1">This Saturday, April 19, Hayes competed in Stony Brook’s Wolfie Invitational. He placed second in the 100-meter, 4x100 and 4x400 relays. Hayes said he prefers the long jump over sprinting.</p>
<p class="p1">“Long jump is definitely more entertaining, just because you get more than one crack at it, “ Hayes said, as the competitors are allowed three jumps in that particular event. “Running is more like ‘ready, set, go’ and you’re off, the race is over. I like long jumping more because there are so many different aspects of it, other than just running.”</p>
<p class="p1">Hayes looks forward to life after graduation. He majors in health science, with a concentration in healthcare management. Hayes’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>long-term dream has been to do missionary work. He would love to go to Somalia and back to Ghana, after he visiting during his junior year of high school.</p>
<p class="p1">“What I’m going to miss the most is definitely making fun of my teammates,” Hayes said. “And being able to have a team, watching them compete.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The familiar drive to Port Jefferson becomes a completely new and exciting experience when one is a member of the Stony Brook University Sailing Club. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The temperature and the direction of the wind are suddenly determining factors for the success of the practice. Unlike the unsettling amount of wind on campus, the perfect amount of wind is a necessity for the sailors in order to do what they love.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Despite being an incredibly young organization, for the Stony Brook University Sailing Club, the water runs deep. The four-year-old club strives to create an environment for both new and experienced sailors that is highly competitive, yet welcoming, nurturing and, most importantly, fun.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The organization is a club team, meaning that any student with interest can join. Members can, and are encouraged, to take part in regattas with adequate training. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the first time since its inception, during the second weekend of April the Sailing Club held its own regatta, The Stony Brook Cup.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At The Stony Brook Cup, sailing teams traveled from Columbia, Fordham and Princeton to compete. The Stony Brook Sailing team, through many long days of practice, dedication and drive under coach Geoffrey Loffredo, came in second place against its elder competitors, beating both Columbia and Princeton. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jason Rose, a political science lecturer at Stony Brook University, has been the faculty advisor for the club since it was first started. Rose lights up with excitement when talking about the club.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In addition to the passion of the team’s sailors and the support the club receives from campus recreation, Rose attributes the teams rapid growth and success to Loffredo, who has been the sailing team’s coach for the past three years. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Loffredo puts in around 60 hours a week to ensure that the members of team are improving, growing and receiving the support they need to be competitive in regattas. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The reason we are where we are now is because of him, because of the tremendous work he has done,” Rose said about Loffredo. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Loffredo is amazed at how much the sailing team has grown since it was created.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The growth of the team increased my time commitment which is great because that is the ultimate goal, to keep growing the team,” he said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I think something that is very important to recognize about the team is that we strive to make sure we continue balancing the competitive aspect with providing the opportunity for any student here at Stony Brook to experience sailing.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Loffredo explained that members of the club do not necessarily have to compete in regattas. The sailing club gives its members the option to volunteer during events, participate in regattas, or just hone the skill of sailing and have the opportunity to get on the water. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The team’s treasurer, 19-year-old Avi Mayerhoff, is a political science major. For him, being on the sailing club team is an important aspect of his college life. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“One of the greatest things that our club team can bring to anything is that it brings in a lot of student leaders,” Mayerhoff said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The team’s President, Cody Murphy, a 22-year-old electrical engineering major, is an example of a student leader on the team.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition to being the president of the sailing club, he is also a resident assistant in Tabler Quad. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Murphy, like the team, has grown incredibly fast. With only two years of sailing, he attributes his rapid success to determination and practice. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The sailors determine where we are going in terms of events but also in the long term. The reason why we have grown so far so fast, is the students, Jay and Geoff, but also because we have a team of people who are really involved and dedicated to seeing us grow,” Mayerhoff said.</span></p>

		<title>Bill Maher&#039;s Zayn Malik joke should be treated like a joke</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_39381" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-39381 size-full-width" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ENTER_MUS-ONEDIRECTION_5_FL-600x508.jpg" alt="SUN SENTINEL / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE" width="600" height="508" /> Outspoken liberal comedian Bill Maher drew outcry earlier this month when he compared former One Direction band member Zayn Malik, above, to Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Many believed the joke was religiously motivated due to Malik's Muslim faith. <em>SUN SENTINEL / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE</em>[/caption]

“Real Time” comedian Bill Maher drew outcry on the internet earlier this month by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bhsxsSCWI4">comparing</a> former One Direction member Zayn Malik’s likeness to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the surviving Boston Marathon bomber.

Fans of One Direction and those who have a bone to pick with the famously-outspoken liberal took to their keyboards to criticize him for comparing the Muslim Malik to a terrorist. The response was large enough to be covered by major news outlets like Time and The Guardian, and to elicit an on-air response from Maher himself. In a segment called "Explaining Jokes to Idiots," he deconstructed the video in question, stating that he found out that Malik was Muslim after the joke and that it was predicated on physical likeness alone. This makes sense, as the two look alike.

Here is a case of a joke being taken seriously and political correctness being demanded in a situation where it is not needed and ought not to be desired.

I consider myself an ex-Bill Maher fan. I was drawn to his far-left comedy around the age of 16, but became bothered when he began taking what I observed to be an increasingly hostile stance towards Islam as a whole while critiquing extremists. In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vln9D81eO60">October debate</a> with Ben Affleck, Maher agreed with a guest’s statement that “Islam is the motherlode of bad ideas,” saying “it’s just a fact.”

This, frankly, pissed<strong> </strong>me off. Humor aside, Maher has a tendency to unfairly generalize the Muslim world and those who practice Islam. This, however, is not one of those times.

I stopped watching Maher because things he said in a serious context bothered me, not because I was offended by his jokes, which target various groups and individuals. The only two people in the world that have reason be offended by this joke are Malik and Tsarnaev. If Malik was offended by the comparison I would understand, and if for some reason Tsarnaev were as well, then at least some good came from all this. The opinion of anybody else in this situation is irrelevant.

Comedy exists to bring entertainment to people. At the end of the day, any messages or opinions carried in a joke, however important or grim, come second to its entertainment value. Humor complements meaningful discussion of any topic well because it paints the absurd as important and allows us to view the often less-than-joyful realities of the world without forcing us to confront them and their implications. Comedy, like Instagram filters, is for when you know something is not great or even remotely good, but it just needs to be shared.

In this same vein, you can think of political correctness as the jerk who calls someone out for using a filter. I hate filters and I think they ruin photographs, but if you like them, you do you. I am not in the picture.

If you do not think something is funny, you do not need to laugh; you do not need to be in the audience, just leave. If you ruin the fun for everyone else, you might soon become the joke.]]></content:encoded>

But you never noticed how he does this with Christianity -- the "hostile stance toward Christianity as a whole," that is. Even now Maher arguably spends more time and hostility on Christianity.  ]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Letter to the Editor: The Statesman failed to cover LGBTQ services</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Submitted by Mallory Rothstein. Rothstein is a senior majoring in psychology,   one of the organizers for the Boobs &amp; Bras event and the former Undergraduate Student Government Executive Vice President.</em>

<em>Have a response to an article published by the Statesman? Send a Letter to the Editor to editors@sbstatesman.com.</em>

Last week, I pitched a story to your News Editor surrounding the 40th Celebration of the LGBTA at Stony Brook University and she agreed that it would be a good event for <em>The Statesman</em> to cover. But when I attended the event last Sunday, I was disappointed that I didn't see either a reporter or a photographer anywhere. When I messaged her asking why there was no one there, she said that she couldn't get anyone to take the story.

Soon after, I saw on <em>The Stateman's</em> Instagram account that there were three photographers who were attending Holi which was on the same day around the same time.

This made me extremely disappointed in <em>The Statesman's</em> leadership.

I don't understand how you as editors can allow three photographers to go to the same event yet not push for at least one photographer to attend the LGBTA celebration. How could you not get even a single photographer or reporter to the celebration?

The 40th Anniversary Celebration was a huge moment in history for the LGBTQ* community at Stony Brook University and one <em>The Statesman</em> should have prioritized. This was the first big celebration ever of the LGBTA. The two big co-sponsors were the Stony Brook Alumni Association and Library Mutual. They originally expected only around 50 people to come when around 95 people ended up attending! There were tons of undergraduate students, graduate students, alumni, faculty, and professional staff all proud to be part of, had been a part of, or just a huge supporter of the LGBTA.

Lucy Winer was the keynote speaker, a distinguished filmmaker and alumni from Stony Brook University. Throughout her talk she even showed everyone different clips from her films which were incredibly powerful. During the closing remarks there was even a huge announcement made about the future execution of a LGBT Center on campus is planned to be in the works within the next couple of years.

You missed a truly historic and newsworthy event.

This year the LGBTQ* Services moved from the Center of Prevention and Outreach (CPO) to the Division of Student Life. Stony Brook Athletics hosted two You Can Play (LGBT organization) nights at basketball games. The Transcending Gender Project visited campus. There was the 40th Anniversary Celebration of the LGBTA at Stony Brook University. And, these were just the major things.

Yet, <em>The Statesman</em> failed to cover any of them.

I strongly urge the editors and entire staff of <em>The Statesman</em> to see the importance of covering news and events that are related to the LGBTQ* community on campus. I understand you can't cover everything but it is a special time for the LGBTQ* community and one that I feel <em>The Statesman</em> must prioritize and capture more so than it ever has before.

Stony Brook University will be hosting its first ever Lavender Graduation this year to celebrate and acknowledge the accomplishments of the students in the LGBTQ* community. This is the perfect opportunity to send one of your reporters and photographers to report on a historic moment for the LGBTQ* community at Stony Brook University.

I'll definitely be there and I hope to see one of you there too. Thank you.]]></content:encoded>

The team hits the road to face Seton Hall on Thursday. <em>EFAL SAYED / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

Behind two dominant pitching performances, the Stony Brook softball team swept a home doubleheader against UMass Lowell on Wednesday, winning the matchups by scores of 3-0 and 2-0.

The wins improved the Seawolves’ America East record to 9-2, propelling the team into sole-possession of first place in the conference.

“It always feels good to beat a conference team,” Stony Brook pitcher Allison Cukrov said.

The first game was a pitcher's duel. Stony Brook's Jane Sallen and UMass Lowell's Marielle Handley both stifled their opposition with stellar pitching, as the game remained scoreless until the bottom of the fifth.

Stony Brook broke the scoreless tie when catcher Allie Pisciotta came to the plate. She hit a two-run home run, her third of the season, to put the Seawolves ahead 2-0.

“As we saw more pitches, I was able to make adjustments,” Pisciotta said.

Once the Pisciotta home run gave Stony Brook the lead, shutdown pitching carried the team the rest of the way. Sallen was removed in the sixth after pitching 5.1 scoreless innings in favor of Cukrov, who recorded the save as the Seawolves won 3-0.

After closing the first game, Cukrov took the mound to start the second game against UMass Lowell's Erica Armenti and was nearly perfect. She allowed just one hit, a single to the leadoff hitter, and faced the minimum as she retired the next 20 batters in order.

“I’ve seen Allison Cukrov pitch a lot of good games,” Seawolves coach Megan Bryant said. “She was real good today. She did a great job of getting ahead in the count and gave us a chance to win.”

The Seawolves got on the board first in the bottom of the third, when two UMass Lowell errors prolonged what could have been a short inning. With runners on first and second and one out, Pisciotta hit a routine ground ball that was booted by shortstop Alisha Welch to load the bases.

Once the bases were loaded, Stony Brook third baseman Chelsea Evans hit a comebacker to Armenti that could have been an inning-ending double play. But after getting the force at home, the throw to first was mishandled by River Hawks first baseman Vanessa Cooper, which allowed Stony Brook to score the game's first run.

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">The Seawolves were able to take a 1-0 lead despite recording just one hit in the inning.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">“We try and take advantage of every opportunity we get,” Pisciotta said. “So if we can get on base, move people over, and score some runs, we will.”</span>

This run proved to be the only thing Stony Brook needed to win, as Cukrov continued her dominance on the mound. Although a Kellie Reynolds RBI single in the sixth would provide Stony Brook with an insurance run, UMass Lowell was kept off of the scoreboard for the second straight game.

The doubleheader sweep puts the Seawolves in a very favorable conference position. Stony Brook holds a one-game conference lead with five games remaining against opponents Albany and UMBC, with a twin bill scheduled against the Great Danes for April 28.

“Every America East game is big,” Bryant said. “We have our work cut out for us with Albany and UMBC left, so we just have to take it one game at a time and play the best that we can.”

She was assisted by freshman Kylie Ohlmiller on two of the goals. <em>MANJU SHIVACHARAN / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

Sophomores Courtney Murphy and Dorrien Van Dyke led the way for the No. 6/5 Stony Brook Seawolves in their 12-8 romp of the Hofstra Pride Tuesday night, April 21, in Hempstead, N.Y.

Murphy led the Seawolves in the first half with a hat trick. After letting Hofstra get off to an early one-goal lead, the Seawolves equalized on her first goal of the game. Murphy kept coming back for more. Her next goal gave the Seawolves their first lead of the game at 3-2. Even after Hofstra tied it again at three, Murphy was able to push the envelope and give the Seawolves another lead.

However, the game was not just an unaided effort by Murphy. Van Dyke closed out a tight first half by giving the Seawolves the lead for good at 5-4.  Her first goal of the game came off of a pass from junior Taylor Ranftle and jump-started a four-goal run for the Seawolves.

Van Dyke opened up the second with her second goal of the game. Her last goal of the night came on a free position shot with less than ten minutes left to play.

Along with Murphy and Van Dyke, freshman Kylie Ohlmiller led the charge for the Seawolves. Her two goals were accompanied by an assist, giving her three points on the night. Sophomore Kristin Yevoli also had two goals, giving her ten total for the season.

After their win against backyard rival Hofstra, Stony Brook will come back to Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium to take on America East rival UMass Lowell in their last regular season game at 7 p.m. on Saturday, April 25.

<p dir="ltr">Late inning heroics from Jeremy Giles and Jack Parenty allowed the Seawolves to pull out the 12-6 win against the Central Connecticut Blue Devils on Wednesday, April 22 in New Britain, Connecticut.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The offense started quickly  as Central Connecticut was the first to score in the bottom of the first inning, taking the lead 1-0.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, the Seawolves managed to take control of the game, as their pitching soon tightened up for the next four innings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The trio of Nicholas DiEva, Tim Knesik and Joseph Guercio combined for five innings of four-hit, one-run baseball. In that time frame, the Seawolves flexed their offensive muscle, giving opposing starter Jesse Frawley trouble over his six innings pitched.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the second inning, Casey Baker doubled and was then driven in by Giles. Additionally, a throwing error let Cole Peragine score in the third.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After a scoreless fourth inning with the score 2-1, a pair of doubles from Toby Handley and Malcolm Nachmanoff let the Seawolves put up two more runs in the fifth.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cole Creighton scored on a fielder’s choice in the sixth to give the Seawolves a big 5-1 lead, but it would not last long.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stony Brook pitcher Aaron Pinto was roughed up in the sixth inning, with a pair of doubles plating four of the five baserunners he allowed. Central Connecticut was the only team that scored in the seventh, putting the Seawolves in a 6-5 deficit heading into the eighth.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, the Seawolves rose to the challenge. They exploded for seven runs, batting through the entire order. Giles came up twice, with a single from which he later scored and a double that drove in three runs. Parenty batted in two more runs himself, while Handley and Bobby Honeyman both added RBI off of walks. Central Connecticut had no hope of answering this eruption, and the Seawolves took the win 12-6.</p>
Giles was the star of the game, extending his hitting streak to nine games with a three-hit, four-RBI performance. Nick Brass picked up the first win of the season, while Stanley Wolpiuk of Central Connecticut took the loss. It was a great day for pretty much every Seawolf involved, with every starter recording a hit.

The Seawolves will hope to take this momentum to their next series, where they will face off over three games against their rivals, the Albany Great Danes on Saturday, April 25 at 12 p.m. and 3 p.m. and then again on Sunday, April 26 at 12 p.m.]]></content:encoded>

A New York County Supreme Court judge has ordered a hearing at which Stony Brook University must justify its custody of two chimpanzees, but the order has raised the question of whether the chimpanzees can be granted human rights.

Justice Barbara Jaffe gave <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=4D9287VfBiI66TYZPi4P1w==&amp;system=prod">the order</a> on April 20 after the Nonhuman Rights Project filed <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=GrZrfouu8z_PLUS_Cy71GX0IEaw==&amp;system=prod">a lawsuit against the university</a>. Jaffe’s original order granted the two chimps a “writ of habeas corpus,” which gave the chimps the human right to challenge their allegedly illegal imprisonment, but Jaffe later amended the order by removing the phrase.

The Nonhuman Rights Project, a Florida-based organization, filed the lawsuit on behalf of Hercules and Leo, two male chimpanzees owned by New Iberia Research Center in Louisiana that are used for locomotion research in the Department of Anatomical Sciences at Stony Brook University.

“The University does not comment on the specifics of litigation, and awaits the court's full consideration on this matter,” Lauren Sheprow, the university’s media relations officer, said in an email.

In the lawsuit petition, the Nonhuman Rights Project wrote that the chimps are “autonomous and self-determining beings who possess those complex cognitive abilities sufficient for common law personhood and the common law right to bodily liberty, as a matter of common law liberty, equality or both.”

Steven Wise, a lawyer who is the founder and president of the Nonhuman Rights Project, said his organization petitioned for both a writ of habeas corpus and an order to show case, which requires Stony Brook to justify keeping the chimps, in order to “cover all the bases.” He said even though the writ of habeas corpus was struck out of Jaffe’s order, the Nonhuman Rights Project is still pleased with the results.

“In the end, it doesn’t matter what route you take to get Stony Brook to justify its detention of Hercules and Leo,” Wise said. “We’re just happy that the judge has given us a chance to argue this in court.”

The Nonhuman Rights Project <a href="http://www.nonhumanrightsproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Suffolk-Verified-Petition-of-E.Stein-and-S.Wise_.pdf">first filed the lawsuit</a> in December 2013 in Suffolk County Supreme Court. Judge W. Gerard Asher <a href="http://www.nonhumanrightsproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Suffolk-Decision-Hercules-and-Leo-12-5-13.pdf">denied the group’s petition</a> for habeas corpus on the ground that the chimps were not legally persons.

The organization also filed lawsuits for the release of two other chimpanzees living in New York: <a href="http://www.nonhumanrightsproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Petition-re-Tommy-Case-Fulton-Cty-NY.pdf">Tommy</a>, a male chimp living on a lot owned by Circle L Trailers in Gloversville, and <a href="http://www.nonhumanrightsproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Niagara-Verified-Petition-E.Stein-and-S.Wise_.pdf">Kiko</a>, a male chimp living in The Primate Sanctuary in Niagara Falls. Both of these lawsuits were dismissed by their respective courts.

The lawsuit petitions asked the judges to grant the chimps writ of habeas corpus and to order for the chimps to be moved to a sanctuary within the North American Primate Sanctuary Alliance.

The Nonhuman Rights Project filed <a href="http://www.nonhumanrightsproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/3a.-Second-Dept-Record-on-Appeal-Hercules-Leo1.pdf">an appeal</a> for Hercules and Leo’s lawsuit to the New York Supreme Court’s Appellate Division, Second Judicial Department in Brooklyn, but the judges <a href="http://www.nonhumanrightsproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/4.-Dismissal-of-Appeal-4-3-14-Hercules-Leo.pdf">dismissed the appeal</a> in April 2014.

The Nonhuman Rights Project then refiled its petition for Hercules and Leo in March 2015, this time in the New York County Supreme Court. If the court rules in favor of the Nonhuman Rights Project, the chimps will be released from the university and sent to Save the Chimps, a Florida sanctuary.

The hearing is <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=4UIVJH2yqedLIQ/9I/yEaQ==&amp;system=prod">scheduled for May 27 at 10:30 a.m.</a> in the New York County Courthouse on Centre Street in Manhattan.]]></content:encoded>

The Latin American Student Organization (LASO) team, which included the lead chef at Roth Market Fresh, John Bell, cooked this flavorful Spanish paella (pictured above).  KRYSTEN MASSA / THE STATESMAN[/caption]

Stony Brook University students were offered a lunch packed with heat and Caribbean flare on the afternoon of April 22.

The Seawolves Food Show hosted the Caribbean Cook-Off in the Student Activities Center this past Wednesday, allowing attendees to taste student-made Caribbean dishes for $5 a person.

The goal of the event was to broaden the diversity of food available on campus, which is why the Seawolves Food Show collaborated with the Latin American Student Organization (LASO), the Caribbean Student Organization (CSO), the Faculty Student Association (FSA), Campus Dining Services and the student team "City Soul," according to Kareema Charles, the event organizer.

Hungry guests entered SAC Ballroom A around noon to the rich smell of Caribbean spices and proceeded to the tables to pick from entrees and desserts.

The competitors, City Soul, The Caribbean Student Organization and The Latin American Student Organization, were comprised of three students and a Campus Dining chef. Each team prepared an entree and a dessert to be judged by the crowd.

What was on the menu?

City Soul served a crowd favorite: rasta pasta with zesty jerk chicken and a side of soulful corn bread, along with red velvet cake for dessert.

The Caribbean Student Organization (CSO) prepared oxtail with rice, peas and a lemon sponge cake topped with strawberry for dessert.

The Latin American Student Organization (LASO) team and their chef, John Bell, lead cook at Roth Market Fresh, cooked up some flavorful Spanish paella along with a melt-in-your-mouth flan for dessert.

“My favorite dish was definitely City Soul’s rasta pasta and jerk chicken. The chicken was really soft and still juicy,” Joshua Dickie, a junior physics major, said.

City Soul’s student chefs, Kalin Sims and Randy Ferguson, wanted to bring a New York City favorite to Stony Brook with an added hint of Southern comfort food.

“We’re all from New York, so we wanted to bring something to SBU that NYC is famous for. Footprints Cafe is a restaurant in Brooklyn, it’s very popular and everyone knows about it and rasta pasta is their biggest dish, that's their key dish,” Sims, a senior sociology major and international studies minor, said. The team wanted to bring that chicken to campus.

“We’re making cornbread to add some southern soulfulness,” she added.

Sims and Ferguson are no strangers to caribbean cooking. Sims says that she “chef’s it up in her house all the time” and she makes a lot of Japanese and Southern food. Randy Ferguson learned how to cook with Caribbean flare from his Jamaican mother.

Going off of what Sims had to say about their dish, Ferguson explained a deeper reason behind their participation in the competition: they were asked if they wanted to be apart of the Caribbean Cook-Off by Charles.

“We thought this might be a change for Stony Brook, especially for the black and latino community,” Ferguson said. “This could be a stepping stone for us to say we’re here, we do exist, we’re not just a statistic. This is our voice on the campus saying, ‘hey we want our food.’”

The Caribbean Student Organization and their campus dining chef, Elvis Dilone, made an oxtail dish. Dilone has been a chef at Roth for five years and is no stranger to Caribbean cooking either. The group came up with its entree and dessert dishes together.

“I’m Caribbean myself, I’m Dominican, so I love caribbean food and cooking it,” Dilone said.

Students moved from table to table savoring each dish they tried. City Soul asked the crowd if the jerk chicken made their mouths water and received cheers as a response.

“I came today because I saw a little bit of a different variety with the Caribbean food,” Felipe Farfan, a junior health science major, said.

Farfan was not the only one glad to see a new style of cooking at SBU.

“The Caribbean food is different and that’s why I came down today. I usually go to the SAC but it’s never different there,” Sucorah Berry, a freshman health science major said.

Danni Deng, a freshman mathematics major agreed, stating that she saw this as an activity on the calendar and came down to the event to try new food.

Team LASO’s chefs were a little different than the rest. Chef John Bell, lead chef at Roth Market Fresh, has been cooking since age 15 or 16, attended the Culinary Institute of America and worked at a number of places before ending up at Stony Brook. Unlike the other competitors, Caribbean is not one of Bell’s favorites.

“I don’t cook Caribbean very often. It’s kind of hard because it can get very spicy very fast, it’s not one of my favorite cuisines,but I do like it,” he said. The students on his team chose the recipes for the flavorful Spanish paella and sweet flan.

“The reason why we chose paella was because it’s from Spain and although we are the Latin American Student Organization, we wanted to go further out than the Caribbean and Latin America.,” Sudley Perez, a senior health science major and chef for the LASO team said. “Also, a lot of the foods in the Caribbean are the same as those in latin america so we decided to expand.”

After tasting each teams recipes, the students casted their votes for their favorite dishes.

Team City Soul came out on top, making their dish of rasta pasta and jerk chicken with a side of cornbread available for purchase around campus. They also received a $500 award to donate to an on-campus charity. The team chose to support The Stony Brook Children’s Hospital.

The winning dish will be featured at three dining locations on campus, according to Charles. "Campus Dining is working out the final details, but it's definitely going to be in West Side Dining. The other two locations most likely will be the SAC and Union," she said.

The judges included Dr. Laura Valente, dean of residential education, Timothy Ecklund, dean of students and the winner of last year's Stony Brook Idol, Melanie Ellner.  <em>KRYSTEN MASSA / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

On Wednesday, April 22 on the Staller Steps, the finalists for this year's Stony Brook Idol sang for the students’ votes. Erynn McLeod, a sophomore music major, won it all when she blew away the audience and judges with a performance of Carrie Underwood's “Blown Away.”

This finale began at 1 p.m. and the weather was ideal for the occasion. The grassy steps were filled with students enthusiastic to hear the talent.

This year's judges were the trio of Dr. Laura Valente, dean of residential education, Timothy Ecklund, dean of students and last years SB Idol winner Melanie Ellner.

They judges gave feedback after every performance, but this year, the ultimate decision process was a bit different. Instead of the judges choosing the winner, the audience voted. To vote, students logged into the SB Idol Facebook page.

The competition was steep this year and each contestant brought their own unique style to the event. James Dougherty came in second place after he sang his rendition of “What I’ve Done” by Linkin Park. Ecklund said that Dougherty had the “emotional-rocker thing going on” and that he brought good emotion into the song and gave it his all.

“I was nervous, because I didn’t know how that was going to be accepted. Especially on the steps outside,” Dougherty said about his song choice. “But I chose it because I felt like it was different and I wanted to do something that wasn’t what everyone else was doing.”

Another common theme for the competition was powerful female singers. Two students chose to sing Beyoncé songs and one chose a Jessie J song.

Khairika Al Sinani sang Beyoncé's “Love On Top.” She began to really belt it toward the end of the song, which received a strong response from the crowd. Hiba Hashim also channeled Beyoncé, singing “Listen,” made popular by the movie "Dreamgirls." Hashim had a more raspy voice compared to the types of artists who usually sing the song, but that did not stop her from completely owning it. Valente actually admitted to crying during the performance.

“You gave it every ounce of emotion it deserved,” Valente said.

Matthew Paige was the only other male contestant. He took a different approach from rocker-dude Dougherty, choosing instead to sit on stage with his keyboard and perform an original song, titled “Don’t Run Away.” His soothing voice captivated the crowd. After he performed, Ecklund expressed his approval, saying “John Legend, look out!”

The host for the event was Joe Rock from WBAB radio station. Rock lost count of the amount of times that he has helped with this event.

“I thought the talent was amazing,” Rock said. “I kind of feel like more people are starting younger, which I am really encouraged by and I think it shows at the level that they have when they get to college.”

After McLeod was announced the winner her friends and fans ran off of the Staller steps to go hug her, followed by a crowd of people who went to congratulate and hug their friends who were in the competition.

“I feel amazing, that was the best feeling ever.” McLeod said after winning it all. As the first-place winner, McLeod receives a $300 Seawolves gift card and the opportunity to perform at the Shirley Strum Kenny Student Arts Festival closing ceremony.

This was McLeod’s first time involved in SB Idol and she was in shock that she won.

“I practice a lot and I picked a song that I felt really connected to,” McLeod said about her song choice. “I’m just so, so happy that I had this opportunity and I was so blessed to perform with so many other amazing singers and I feel so lucky.”]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>By Megan Miller and Julianne Cuba</strong>

Stony Brook University is a big place, and it is ranked among the top 40 public universities in the country by U.S. News &amp; World Report. With a campus of over 20,000 graduate and undergraduate students, trying to find your niche as an incoming student can be a pretty difficult feat—but this list will make it easier. If you are concerned about how you will make it through a semester without a quality cup of coffee, your weekly yoga class or just an ear to listen, SBU has got you covered. These are eight important people you should meet on campus that will make adjusting to college life a little smoother.

<b>The Student Voice</b>

[caption id="attachment_39574" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<img class="wp-image-39574 size-full-width" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/DSC_2675-600x400.jpg" alt="Who to meet: Timothy R. Ecklund, Dean of Students and Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs “I’m a dream maker. So when students come and have dreams of being a college student and achieving a college degree, I’d like to think that we are positioned to help them reach that dream.” MEGAN MILLER / THE STATESMAN " width="600" height="400" /> Who to meet: Timothy R.

What he does: Timothy Ecklund’s function at Stony Brook is to understand the students. His primary duty is to hear student voices and learn what the student body wants and needs in order to achieve their goals. The Dean of Students Office, Room 222 in the Student Activities Center, also houses the Office of Multicultural Affairs and LGBTQ Services. In addition, there are almost 400 campus clubs and organizations registered through the Office of Student Activities under the Dean of Students’ Office, which makes it an ideal place to visit for students looking to see what student life Stony Brook has to offer. Ecklund is a former Associate Vice President of Buffalo State, where he spent 14 years dealing primarily with student affairs.

<b>The Career Counselor</b>

[caption id="attachment_39576" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<img class="size-full-width wp-image-39576" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/DSC_2530_1-600x448.jpg" alt="Who to meet: Caterina Reed, Walk-In Advisor at the Career Center “It’s just better to start early. Usually students wait until they are juniors or seniors and we can still help them but it does take a longer time for the process to begin. If you come in as a freshman, we can work on your resume, help you look for part-time jobs, either on or off campus through ZebraNet, which is our job database. We’re [counselors], so if you’re indecisive about your major or your career, we help with all that.” JULIANNE CUBA / THE STATESMAN " width="600" height="448" /> Who to meet: Caterina Reed, Walk-In Advisor at the Career Center<br />“It’s just better to start early.

What she does: Caterina Reed is the first person students will meet when they walk into the Career Center, located at W0550 Melville Library. For any student, professor or alumni who visits the Career Center, Reed will assess their needs and schedule an appointment with the most appropriate counselor for whatever the situation may be. Besides offering assistance in résumé and cover letter building, the Career Center also offers counseling for those students who are still undecided in either career path or major. For on- and off-campus jobs, the career center offers ZebraNet, Stony Brook’s job database.

<b>The Therapist</b>

&nbsp;

What he does: Julian Pessier oversees 30 different counselors on staff at CAPS. For any problem students may be having, CAPS is there to help. For those looking to talk, students can make a free appointment for up to 12 sessions. If a student requires more attention, counselors will provide outside referrals for more permanent assistance. Stony Brook University makes counseling an accessible tool. According to the CAPS website, they not only provide individual sessions but also “group psychotherapy, psychiatry consultation and medication management, mindfulness meditation, [and] couple's therapy.” The department has flexible hours intended to accommodate different schedules and can be found in two locations: the Student Health Center on Stadium Road and the Health Sciences Center on the East Campus.

<b>The Nutritionist</b>

[caption id="attachment_39567" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<img class="size-full-width wp-image-39567" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/DSC_9838-600x428.jpg" alt="Who to meet: Kristina Tiernan, Nutritionist for Campus Dining “It is important for students to know they have an on campus resource if they want to discuss how to eat healthier, how to lose, gain or maintain their weight, how to build muscle tone or how to identify foods appropriate for their special dietary needs or restricted diets.” PHOTO CREDIT: JULIANNE CUBA " width="600" height="428" /> Who to meet: Kristina Tiernan, Nutritionist for Campus Dining<br />“It is important for students to know they have an on campus resource if they want to discuss how to eat healthier, how to lose, gain or maintain their weight, how to build muscle tone or how to identify foods appropriate for their special dietary needs or restricted diets.” <em>PHOTO CREDIT: JULIANNE CUBA</em>[/caption]

What she does: As the Campus Dining dietitian, Kristina Tiernan provides free private nutrition counseling to students and works with students to provide healthier menu choices and help students accommodate special dietary needs such as kosher, halal, vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free foods and food allergies. She also meets with athletes and sports teams to improve performance through nutrition counseling, calculate and update nutritional information for the foods served on campus and develop programs to assist students in adopting healthier lifestyles. Tiernan is a resource for students who want to discuss how to eat healthier, how to lose, gain or maintain their weight, how to build muscle tone or how to identify foods appropriate for their special dietary needs or restricted diets.

<b>The Athlete</b>

[caption id="attachment_39582" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<img class="size-full-width wp-image-39582" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/DSC_2403-600x420.jpg" alt="Who to meet: Dean Bowen, Assistant Director of Fitness and Wellness Programs for the Department of Campus Recreation “We have any and every activity you could think of, and if we don’t, we’re always open to new ideas and new things to keep the students moving outside the classroom.” PHOTO CREDIT: MEGAN MILLER" width="600" height="420" /> Who to meet: Dean Bowen, Assistant Director of Fitness and Wellness Programs for the Department of Campus Recreation<br />“We have any and every activity you could think of, and if we don’t, we’re always open to new ideas and new things to keep the students moving outside the classroom.” <em>PHOTO CREDIT: MEGAN MILLER</em>[/caption]

What he does: Not only does Dean Bowen take the time to sweat with his students (he teaches multiple classes at the top-of-the-line Campus Recreation Center), but he also assists in developing a comprehensive wellness program each semester that include over 50 free classes held per week. For students interested in tailoring their gym experience to meet their specific fitness needs, there are 16 experienced personal trainers to choose from (including Bowen). Also included in the comprehensive wellness program is a number of social exercise events scheduled throughout the semester, which have included a ski trip to Catamount Mountain in upstate New York and a Brooklyn Nets game.

<b>The Barista</b>

[caption id="attachment_39579" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<img class="size-full-width wp-image-39579" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/DSC_2434-600x527.jpg" alt="Who to meet: Kevin Singh, Barista at the Student Union Starbucks “I’m a people person, so I like talking with people, interacting with people, and I try to keep a smile on at all times.” PHOTO CREDIT: JULIANNE CUBA " width="600" height="527" /> Who to meet: Kevin Singh, Barista at the Student Union Starbucks<br />“I’m a people person, so I like talking with people, interacting with people, and I try to keep a smile on at all times.” <em>PHOTO CREDIT: JULIANNE CUBA</em>[/caption]

What he does: Kevin Singh makes finals week a little less dreary by whipping up the classics, such as a cool caramel Frappuccino on a blistering hot day, a pumpkin spice latte to inspire holiday spirit, or an original Americano. There is a variety of sweet treats, sandwiches, salads and snacks to stave off that hungry belly. After applying to the Student Union Starbucks, one of the busiest locations on Long Island, Singh received the highly sought-after position a year ago—so he has plenty of experience to meet your caffeine needs.

<b>The Chef</b>

[caption id="attachment_39572" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<img class="size-full-width wp-image-39572" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/DSC_2714-600x504.jpg" alt="Who to meet: Kevin Kessler, Owner and Chef of Backstreat Burger Food Truck “I’ve worked on college campuses before, and I know what the kids like.

What he does: You don’t have to look far for restaurant-style food—Kevin Kessler, who said he is an executive chef by trade, is grilling specialty burgers, Philly cheesesteak sandwiches and cheesy quesadillas to ignite your taste buds all semester long. Conveniently located outside the Student Union with over 15 menu options to choose from, food prepared fresh every morning, and convenient hours from 11 a.m. until 4 p.m. Monday through Thursday and Friday from 11 a.m. until 3 p.m., you’ll be sure to have your cravings thoroughly satisfied.

<b>The Postal Service Expert</b>

This year’s Brookfest concert, featuring B.o.B, Twenty-One Pilots and Panic! at The Disco at the Island Federal Credit Union Arena, resulted in a large success for the Undergraduate Student Government, making it the first sold-out concert since Wiz Khalifa in 2012. Students filled the arena and vibed to the mix of genres the show had to offer.

While B.o.B performed his latest hit “Not For Long,” as well as his popular collaboration with Taylor Swift, “Both Of Us,” he really got the crowd going with the 2010 throwback hit “Airplanes.” He then spread his “wings” and fell into the crowd.

Twenty One Pilots followed B.o.B and the group served as a good transition between artists because their sound sways from alternative to rap. The duo features Josh Dun on the drums and Tyler Joseph on lead vocals.

Their ukulele cover of DJ Khaled’s “All I Do Is Win” caught the crowd’s attention and they kept that energy when they segued into their hit “House Of Gold.”

Joseph told the audience about the band’s tradition of crowd surfing over audience on a surfboard.

“The university told us we were not allowed,” Joseph said, “I wanted to be on top of all you guys, but they shut that down.”

The duo from Columbus, Ohio also performed their new hit single “Tear In My Heart,” from their album, Blurryface, set to release on May 19.

“Ballad of Mona Lisa” radiated through the arena to introduce Panic! at the Disco. Lead Singer Brendon Urie hyped up the crowd and then he went into the song “Only Difference Between Martyrdom And Suicide Is Press Coverage.”

The band played hits including “This is Gospel,” “Nine in the Afternoon” and “New Perspective,” as well their new single, “Hallelujah.”

Senior Jasmine Cervantes said she tweeted the band multiple times to cover “Bohemian Rhapsody” and to her and everyone else’s excitement, they did.

[caption id="attachment_39623" align="alignleft" width="300"]<img class="size-half-width wp-image-39623" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/brookfest2015_heather.khalifa_33-300x200.jpg" alt="HEATHER KHALIFA / THE STATESMAN" width="300" height="200" /> Students in the front row of the standing section at this year's Brookfest concert react to Panic! at the Disco. <em>HEATHER KHALIFA / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

Of course, the show came to a close with the 2005 anthem,  “I Write Sins Not Tragedies.”

“I’ve never really listened to Panic! at the Disco or Twenty One Pilots, but they were pretty good. Overall, they did a great job,” Ahmed Khokhar, a sophomore, said

The mix of alternative music and hip-hop was a refreshing twist to Stony Brook’s annual Brookfest. The predicted distaste for this year’s concert was proven wrong by the hundreds of fans that came out to enjoy the concert, even those with the slim knowledge of alternative music that only reached as far as the mainstream Panic! At The Disco song “I Write Sins Not Tragedies.”

Bass player and vocalist Tom Fasano of Nice Shot, Kid was pleased with the effort made to include different genres at this year’s Brookfest.

Nice Shot, Kid opened in last weeks Streetlight Manifesto performance and last semester’s “Back to the Brook” concert.

“I think it’s great that this [Brookfest] is appealing to different genres,” Fasano said, “people opposed the idea of Panic! at the Disco, but look at this turn out.”]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sophomore attacker Courtney Murphy scored six goals, freshman attacker Kylie Ohlmiller totaled nine points and No. 5 Stony Brook annihilated the visiting UMass Lowell River Hawks 22-1 in the women’s lacrosse Senior Game on Saturday night at Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Seawolves’ regular season record finishes at 16-1, with a perfect 6-0 record in America East play. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“One of the things we wanted to do was come out and finish our conference season undefeated,” Head Coach Joe Spallina said after the regular season finale. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We didn’t want to share anything with anybody,” he said, referring to the regular season championship that the team will win outright this season after sharing the title with Albany last year.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The game never truly caused great worry, as Stony Brook is a top-5 team nationally and UMass Lowell is in its inaugural season of Division I women’s lacrosse. The Seawolves asserted their dominance in the opening minutes, making the score 8-0 in the first five minutes, 13-0 in the first 15 minutes and 20-0 by halftime. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Murphy scored four goals on her own in the opening 3:02 of the match. There was one point in the first half when the team scored four goals in a 35-second span.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With Stony Brook leading by 20 at halftime, there seemed a realistic chance that the Seawolves would become only the second team in NCAA history to reach 30 goals in the last 25 years. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We weren’t trying to score in the second half,” said Spallina, who removed most of the starters midway through the first half. The only Stony Brook goals after the break were by senior midfielder Sarah Ehrman and sophomore attacker Nichole Doran, the first goal of the season for both players.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ohlmiller had four goals and five assists and sophomore midfielder Dorrien Van Dyke had three goals and three assists. Eleven different Seawolves players netted a goal in the blowout.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ohlmiller has recently been named one of the 25 finalists for the Tewaaraton Trophy, given annually to the most outstanding lacrosse player in the nation. Ohlmiller is one of only three freshmen in the NCAA to be given the nomination.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“As a freshman, it’s definitely an honor,” Ohlmiller said. “I definitely have my team to thank for it. I wouldn’t have all the assists I have without Michelle [Rubino], without Dorrien [Van Dyke], or without [Courtney] Murph[y].”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“She’s automatic offense,” Spallina said, “She’s got outstanding skills and her lacrosse I.Q. is off the charts. She’s a very, very talented kid.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was the last regular season game for the Stony Brook senior class and they were honored before the game. </span><span class="s1">In their four years donning the Seawolf attire, the class as a whole has a record of 64-18.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“When I was a freshman, coming in, not knowing anyone, the upper class really welcomed us in,” senior captain Rubino reminisced. “That’s what our upper class tried to do this year to the freshman; welcome them in. We’re a young team.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Spallina had nothing but praise for the upcoming graduates.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The senior class is special. They came in the same time that I was hired here, so they were able to be part of the emergence of this program,” he said. “They’ve been a part of it since day one. These guys really helped to put the program on the map.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Looking forward, Stony Brook is back in action on Friday at 5 p.m. at LaValle Stadium, when the team will compete against the UMBC Retrievers in a semifinal matchup of the America East conference tournament.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I told our kids that we’re not guaranteed anything from this point on,” Spallina said. “We have one guaranteed game on our schedule and that’s Friday.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stony Brook baseball has rolled through the America East Conference this season, taking two of three games from two of its opponents and sweeping its last two series. That dominance continued in Albany this weekend, as the Seawolves convincingly took all three games from the Great Danes to increase their lead in the conference to an astounding four games.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After running away late with game one by a score of 15-3, the Seawolves took a pitchers’ duel to the wire en route to a 2-1 victory. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The bats then came alive again in game three, as Stony Brook rolled by a 12-2 score. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Having Tyler Honahan on the mound usually spells success for Stony Brook, and that did not change in game one.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The junior allowed three runs on seven hits in six innings of work and exited the game with a 5-3 advantage that was in the hands of the bullpen.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After holding a 3-0 going into that fifth inning, Albany scored three runs to tie the game up. Shawn Blake roped a double to left-center to cut the lead to 3-2 and Alex Lushkevich scored from third on an RBI groundout to then tie the game. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Whatever hope the Great Danes had after that inning was quickly eradicated, as the Seawolves rattled off 12 unanswered runs, scoring two in the sixth, three in both the seventh and ninth and four in the eighth. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the sixth, a Malcolm Nachmanoff RBI double plated Andruw Gazzola. Nachmanoff then scored from third on a Casey Baker sacrifice fly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Toby Handley tripled to left-center to get the barrage started in the seventh inning, plating a pair of runs. He then scored on a Jack Parenty single up the middle to put the Seawolves lead at 8-3 as Nick Brass took the hill.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After the Great Danes went down in order, Stony Brook went back to work. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cole Peragine and Parenty both drew bases-loaded walks to bring in two runs, Handley drove in another run with a single to right, and a sacrifice fly off the bat of Robert Chavarria gave the Seawolves four in the eighth.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the offense was not done, and they poured it on in the ninth. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Parenty was a big part of it. </span><span class="s1">He laced a bases-loaded triple down the right field line, bringing everybody home.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When it was all said and done, Parenty finished with five RBI on the game, Handley had three of his own and Peragine reached base four times and came around to score every time. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">From high-explosive offense to great defense and pitching, Matt Senk’s squad proved it can win any type of game on a sunny Saturday afternoon, taking the nightcap of the doubleheader in a defensive slugfest after winning the first game in a run-filled affair. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Baker finished the second game with two of the three hits the Seawolves would record on the day, but that was enough for starter Daniel Zamora and closer Cameron Stone, who recorded their fourth win and third save, respectively. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Baker also scored both of the runs for Stony Brook. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He touched home on a wild pitch in the second to give the Seawolves a 1-0 and then doubled that lead with one swing, a home run to right, to make it 2-0.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The third hit was recorded by Parenty, a bunt single in the first inning.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Zamora struck out seven batters in his five innings of work, only allowing one run on four hits. Said run came in the Albany fifth inning, when Alex Lushkevich hit a sacrifice fly to center, scoring Eric Mueller from third to cut the Seawolves’ lead in half. The Great Danes would leave the tying run at third in the inning and not get close to scoring again.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stone, the sophomore reliever, would shut down the Great Danes, only allowing one baserunner in the final two innings of play and clinching the series for Stony Brook.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If there were any negatives taken out of this game, it is that three hitting streaks came to an end in game two. </span><span class="s1">Gazzola and Jeremy Giles had raised theirs to 10 before losing it in game two, and Handley’s came to a halt at eight games in the nightcap. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On Sunday, the Seawolves went for the sweep, and convincingly got it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ryley MacEachern started the game on the mound and already had a lead before throwing a pitch, as the Seawolves threw a three-spot on the board in the top of the first on Albany starter Matt Gallup. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Chavarria singled down the left field line, Baker grounded out to the pitcher and Gazzola singled to first base and before the fans could get settled in at Varsity Field, it was 3-0 Stony Brook. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Seawolves were consistent in their scoring, tallying a run in each of the first five innings, plating three in the first and the third innings. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Three Seawolves recorded multiple RBI in the game, with Baker driving in three runs and Handley and Gazzola each bringing in two. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Baker, along with the RBI groundout in the first, reached on an error in the fourth to bring in Parenty and doubled to left-center in the eighth to plate Handley.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Handley utilized two RBI singles to bring in runs in the second and fifth, while Gazzola singled to first base and center field to plate a pair of Seawolves runs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The game was never in doubt, as Stony Brook led 9-2 after five and coasted to the finish, as four pitchers combined to hold the Great Danes to six hits and only two runs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">MacEachern only went 3.1 innings, striking out five Great Danes batters and only allowing two runs on four hits. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Chad Lee relieved him and was given his fourth win of the season, pitching 3.2 innings and striking out a pair of batters while only allowing two hits. </span><span class="s1">Nicholas DiEva and Teddy Rodliff pitched the eighth and ninth, holding Albany hitless with DiEva recording a pair of batters.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stony Brook is now 12-2 in the America East, with the second-place UMass Lowell River Hawks far behind at 8-6. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1">There is nothing like an April day on the gridiron.</p>
<p class="p1">In the inaugural Frank Conti ‘11 Memorial Spring Game, the Seawolves’ offense, Team Red, was pitted against the Seawolves’ defense, Team Black, in a public football scrimmage on Saturday afternoon at Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium.</p>
<p class="p1">Black won the game, 22-17, showing the prowess of a defense that was ranked third in yards per game allowed in the FCS last season.</p>
<p class="p1">The scrimmage had no kickoffs and all punts were fair-caught. The offense started at the spot of the fair catch after punts and at the 25-yard line after scores.</p>
<p class="p1">Offensive points were tallied with conventional scoring, with six points for a touchdown and an additional one-point PAT kick or a two-point conversion opportunity, along with three for a field goal.</p>
<p class="p1">On defense, four points were given<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>for forcing a turnover before the offense crossed the 50-yard line, while two points were awarded for forcing a turnover after midfield.</p>
<p class="p1">Punts were handled differently, as two points were awarded for forcing a punt before the 50-yard line and one point was granted for forcing a punt after the 50.</p>
<p class="p1">With quarterback Conor Bednarski and running back Stacey Bedell not playing for the Seawolves, it was Joe Carbone and Tyler Fredericks getting the quarterbacking and rushing duties, respectively,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>for Team Red.</p>
<p class="p1">Carbone, a redshirt freshman, was 14-for-24 on the day with 116 yards and an interception while Fredericks, a junior, carried the ball nine times for 87 yards.</p>
<p class="p1">Fredericks’ highlight was when he scampered into the end zone from three yards out in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="p1">Redshirt freshman Pat Irwin and junior Carlos Hernandez both received playing time at quarterback for the Seawolves. Sophomore wide receiver Ray Bolden had a huge day, catching eight passes for 121 yards.</p>
<p class="p1">Another wide receiver, sophomore Julius Wingate added six catches for 39 yards.</p>
<p class="p1">Sophomore running backs Anthony Anderson and Donald Liotine rushed for 40 and 68 yards, respectively. Anderson scored on a seven-yard touchdown run to cut the Black lead to 20-10 early in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="p1">On the defensive side of the ball, star lineman Victor Ochi did not play for Team Black. Kye Morgan, a junior defensive back, recorded an interception and seven tackles. Sophomore defensive back Darin Peart recovered a fumble in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="p1">The fumble recovery and interception each counted as four points toward Black’s score.</p>
<p class="p1">Sophomore defensive back Reggie Allen added nine tackles on the afternoon, the most of any defensive player.</p>
<p class="p1">The Black defense stopped the Red offense eight times for a total of fourteen points. Six of these stops came before the offense crossed the 50-yard line.</p>
<p class="p1">Black began the game by scoring the first nineteen points of the game, before junior kicker Przemyslaw Popek made it 19-3 with a 22-yard field goal. Popek was perfect in the game, drilling both extra points he attempted and making his lone field goal attempt.</p>
<p class="p1">The Frank Conti ‘11 Memorial Spring Game was created this year to honor the legacy of Conti, a former defensive lineman for the Seawolves.</p>
<p class="p1">Conti tragically passed away suddenly in the July of 2011, shortly after his graduation, due to a heart attack.</p>
<p class="p1">The spring game, an annual event, now carries Conti’s name “to cherish the memory of an individual who made a tremendous impact on the program,” Stony Brook Athletics said.</p>
<p class="p1">Seniors Bednarski, Ochi, offensive lineman Jerry Hubshman and linebacker Jeremy Leggiero were named team captains before the game.</p>
<p class="p1">The Stony Brook football team will open its 2015 season on the road against Toledo on September 3 before hosting Central Connecticut in its home opener.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>Point 1: Baseball has to be cautious, even though it is rolling through the America East.</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There is Stony Brook, and then there is the rest of the America East Conference as far as the baseball regular-season race is concerned. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Seawolves currently have a four-game lead over the UMass Lowell River Hawks and have already taken two of three games from the second-year Division I team. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In fact, Stony Brook has only lost two America East games all season, holding a 12-2 record after the weekend sweep of Albany. But the Seawolves have done this before. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Seawolves lost only five conference games last season and ended up blowing a golden opportunity to go back to the NCAA Tournament by losing back-to-back games to the Binghamton Bearcats.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In 2011, Stony Brook only lost two conference games all year but was defeated by Albany in an elimination game despite the Seawolves coming in as the top seed. So, as Stony Brook enters the final three weeks of the season riding high, it would be wise to be cautious.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If the Seawolves want to make the NCAA Tournament, they should make sure history does not repeat itself.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>-By Cameron Boon, Assistant Sports Editor</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>Point 2: Softball has a plethora of dominant pitchers.</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Any successful softball team needs at least one ace pitcher to be a title contender. This is someone that can carry the team to victory in any given game and is capable of thriving in big games.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Stony Brook has two such pitchers in senior Allison Cukrov and junior Jane Sallen. Both have been spectacular for the Seawolves in 2015. Both are top ten in the America East in strikeouts, ERA, wins and innings pitched. This combination has provided a perfect 1-2 punch to propel the Seawolves into first place.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sallen, who has started 21 of the Seawolves’ 37 games, is arguably the most-improved player on the team. She has already surpassed her 2014 totals for starts, wins, innings and strikeouts this season. Without this exponential improvement, the Seawolves would likely be an afterthought in the America East. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Although Cukrov struggled early in the season, the two-time conference Pitcher of the Year appears to have regained her form as of late. </span><span class="s1">She won America East Pitcher of the Week two weeks ago and recorded a near-perfect game last week. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The only hit she allowed was a leadoff single. Cukrov is finding her stride at just the right time, with the conference tournament just two weeks away. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Should the Seawolves face an elimination game, Head Coach Megan Bryant will have quite the dilemma deciding who will pitch. </span><span class="s1">Although this may be a difficult decision to make, it is a good dilemma to have.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>-By Chris Gaine, Staff Writer</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>Point 3: Men’s lacrosse needs to limit scoring in bunches.</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Men’s lacrosse has one of the most efficient offenses in NCAA Division I, led by senior attackman Mike Rooney and junior attackman Brody Eastwood. The Seawolves currently have the second-most goals in the country (225) and are sixth in goals per game (14.06). The group has the offensive prowess to make a deep postseason run, but the Seawolves need to limit the scoring surges they have proven to be prone to. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The squad’s first loss came at the hands of a currently-No. 50 St. John’s team, after the Red Storm scored nine of the game’s last ten goals. In the Seawolves’ third loss to a then-No. 4 Duke team, Stony Brook’s defense let up an eight-goal run in the first half. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Although the team rebounded and hung tough to an end score of 17-11, the hole dug was far too great for the defense to climb out of. </span><span class="s1">Stony Brook came out on top in Friday’s game against Hartford, but not before being down 8-4 at the half for the second time this season. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Freshman midfielder Matt Robison would go on to score the overtime winning goal, but it will be a much greater challenge to come back from a halftime deficit against the more talented teams the Seawolves will face in the postseason, which the game against Duke highlighted. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Stony Brook is tied with Lehigh for the 32nd-best goals per game ratio at 10.06. If the team is going to make it far in the postseason, the defense needs to tighten up and play consistently throughout the whole game.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>-By Chris Peraino, Staff Writer</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>Point 4: Controlling ground balls is imperative for women’s lacrosse. </i></b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In lacrosse, possession is crucial. Unlike sports like football and baseball where there is equal opportunity with possession, lacrosse relies on draw controls and ground balls to determine possession. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Faceoffs and ground balls are designed to be 50-50 opportunities for each team, but the No. 5 Stony Brook women’s lacrosse team has used its speed and hustling ability to secure possession on much greater than 50 percent of these loose balls.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Seawolves have won 52.4 percent of draws this season, winning 16 more draw controls total this season than they have lost. They have grabbed 55.6 percent of loose ground balls this season, or 51 more ground balls total than their opponents.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Stony Brook, on average, earns four more possessions for itself over its opponents each game. </span><span class="s1">For an offense as prolific as Stony Brook’s, its opponents are basically spotting them two goals.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Looking ahead to a probable rematch with Albany for the America East championship, the Great Danes are even better at winning ground balls, securing 57.2 percent this season. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In a high-intensity rivalry game, ground balls will certainly be an aspect of the game to keep an eye on.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sophomore attacker Courtney Murphy scored six goals, freshman attacker Kylie Ohlmiller totaled nine points and No. 5 Stony Brook annihilated the visiting UMass Lowell River Hawks 22-1 in the women’s lacrosse Senior Game on Saturday night at Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Seawolves’ regular season record finishes at 16-1, with a perfect 6-0 record in America East play. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“One of the things we wanted to do was come out and finish our conference season undefeated,” Head Coach Joe Spallina said after the regular season finale. “We didn’t want to share anything with anybody,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Seawolves shared the America East regular season title last season with the Albany Great Danes, with both teams finishing 4-1.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The game never truly caused great worry, as Stony Brook is a top-5 team nationally and UMass Lowell is in its inaugural season of Division I women’s lacrosse. The Seawolves asserted their dominance in the opening minutes, making the score 8-0 in the first five minutes, 13-0 in the first 15 minutes and 20-0 by halftime. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Murphy scored four goals on her own in the opening 3:02 of the match. There was one point in the first half when the team scored four goals in a 35-second span less than five minutes into the opening period.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With Stony Brook leading by 20 at halftime, there seemed a realistic chance that the Seawolves would become only the second team in NCAA history to reach 30 goals in the last 25 years. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We weren’t trying to score in the second half,” Spallina said, who removed most of the starters midway through the first half. The only Stony Brook goals after the break were by senior midfielder Sarah Ehrman and sophomore attacker Nichole Doran, the first goal of the season for both players.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ohlmiller had four goals and five assists and sophomore midfielder Dorrien Van Dyke had three goals and three assists. Eleven different Seawolves players netted a goal in the blowout.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ohlmiller has recently been named one of the 25 finalists for the Tewaaraton Trophy, given annually to the most outstanding lacrosse player in the nation. Ohlmiller is one of only three freshmen in the NCAA to be given the nomination.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“As a freshman, it’s definitely an honor,” Ohlmiller said, immediately giving credit to her teammates. “I definitely have my team to thank for it. I wouldn’t have all the assists I have without Michelle [Rubino], without Dorrien [Van Dyke], or without [Courtney] Murph[y].”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“She’s automatic offense,” Spallina said, “She’s got outstanding skills and her lacrosse I.Q. is off the charts. She’s a very, very talented kid.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was the last regular season game for the Stony Brook senior class and they were honored before the game. </span><span class="s1">In their four years donning the Seawolf attire, the class as a whole has a record of 64-18.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“When I was a freshman, coming in, not knowing anyone, the upper class really welcomed us in,” senior captain Rubino reminisced. “That’s what our upper class tried to do this year to the freshman; welcome them in. We’re a young team.” Spallina had nothing but praise for the upcoming graduates.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The senior class is special. They came in the same time that I was hired here, so they were able to be part of the emergence of this program,” he said. “They’ve been a part of it since day one. These guys really helped to put the program on the map.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Looking forward, Stony Brook is back in action on Friday at 5 p.m. at LaValle Stadium, when the team will compete against the UMBC Retrievers in a semifinal of the America East tournament.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I told our kids that we’re not guaranteed anything from this point on,” Spallina said. “We have one guaranteed game on our schedule and that’s Friday.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A second-half rally by the Stony Brook men’s lacrosse team on Friday night forced the game into extra time where freshman midfielder Matt Robison buried a shot to give Stony Brook a 9-8 win over the Hartford Hawks.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This win marks the second- straight overtime win for the Seawolves as they also defeated Binghamton last week. </span><span class="s1">With the two latest wins, the Seawolves were able to clinch the second seed in the upcoming America East tournament.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After putting themselves in a difficult situation, down 8-4 at half time, the Seawolves regrouped and took control. </span><span class="s1">They went on to put forth an absolutely dominant second half effort and completed the comeback win.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Seawolves fought their way back into the game by scoring five unanswered goals with the fifth being the overtime winner. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The one-sided second-half was really exemplified by the fact that the Hawks were held scoreless for the final 40-plus minutes of the game. </span><span class="s1">Robison, a freshman for Stony Brook, played the role of hero as he scored the overtime goal on a nifty up and down fake, finally going low to beat the goalie. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He finished the night with just the one goal which was only his second in his young college career. </span><span class="s1">Hartford had its push in the first half when the Hawks came out scoring seven goals in the first 17 minutes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They took a 7-2 lead and from there felt they could take their foot off the gas pedal and play defense. </span><span class="s1">Once the Hawks relaxed, however, they could never get back into rhythm. </span><span class="s1">For the Seawolves, it was an opportunity to take advantage. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Hawks had just over a minute left to hold off the Seawolves, but Stony Brook sophomore Ryan Blitzer forced overtime with the game-tying goal with 1:07 left.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Senior attackman Mike Rooney provided the Seawolves with a game high in both points and goals, finishing with seven points from four goals and three assists. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He was the catalyst for the team contributing on seven of nine goals.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The defense of Stony Brook was spectacular causing Hartford to turn the ball over a total of 20 times throughout the game. </span><span class="s1">The defense also limited Hartford to low-quality shots that were turned away nicely by sophomore goalie Hayden Johnstone. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He finished the night with five saves, four of which came in the second half. </span><span class="s1">Hartford’s Kevin O’Shea had a team-high four goals on the night. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He was the only multi-goal scorer for the Hawks, but ultimately he could not do enough to hold on for the win.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stony Brook will now move on to the America East tournament where the Seawolves will play their semifinal against Vermont on Thursday, April 30 at SUNY Albany.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1">The Stony Brook women’s tennis team earned an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament after winning its fourth straight America East Tennis Championship this weekend.</p>
<p class="p1">“This never gets old. This absolutely never gets old,” Head Coach Gary Glassman said.</p>
<p class="p1">Stony Brook, at No. 1, defeated host-Binghamton in the semifinals on Saturday, advancing on to the AEC Championship title match against No. 3 Albany, on Sunday.</p>
<p class="p1">The Seawolves were led by senior and America East Player of the Year Polina Movchan, who helped lead a No. 2 doubles match over Binghamton 8-3 with freshman Yana Nikolaeva and a No. 1 singles match, 2-0; winning each set 6-1.</p>
<p class="p1">Movchan has now won four America East titles in four tries in her career, and was named the 2015 Most Oustanding Player of the Tournament.</p>
<p class="p1">“She’s really been the gamechanger for our program,” Glassman said. “What a career.”</p>
<p class="p1">Doubles team Nadia Smergut, and Louise Badoche, defeated opponents Agatha Ambrozy and Katherine Medianik of Binghamton 8-3 as well.</p>
<p class="p1">Kristina Vozniak and Elizabeth Tsvetkov tied their doubles match against Binghamton, 6-6. Smergut also won her singles match, defeating Binghamton’s Alexis Tashiro 6-0, 6-4. Tsvetkov defeated Annie DiMuro 6-4, 6-1 to secure Stony Brook’s undefeated victory.</p>
<p class="p1">No. 1 Stony Brook defeated No. 3 Albany on 4-0 on Sunday, claiming the title as the AEC Champions for the fourth consecutive year.</p>
<p class="p1">The Seawolves got 8-4 and 8-3 victories from their Smergut/Badoche and Tsvetkov/Vozniak doubles pairs. Stony Brook earned straight-set wins from Vozniak, Adey Osabuohien and Tsvetkov in singles matches, sweeping the Great Danes again as it had earlier in the season.</p>
<p class="p1">In an earlier matchup this year, the Seawolves defeated Albany 7-0.</p>
<p class="p1">This season is recorded as one of Stony Brook’s best with a 15-1 record, losing only to No. 36 Harvard, 5-2.</p>
<p class="p1">“This is just a really special year because we accomplished so many of the goals that we set out to do, one to beat a nationally ranked school, become nationally ranked, and this is always our main goal, to win the conference championship,” Glassman said. “Pretty much, we ticked almost everything off the list.”</p>
<p class="p1">The Seawolves will learn their fate on Tuesday, April 28 at 5 p.m. when the 64-team NCAA Women’s Tennis Tournament Bracket will be unveiled during a stream available on NCAA.com. Stony Brook lost to Texas A&amp;M in last year’s NCAA Tournament.</p>]]></content:encoded>

MANJU SHIVACHARAN / THE STATESMAN" width="608" height="405" /></a> USG Treasurer Kathryn Michaud, above, presented an explanation of the 2015-2016 budget to the senators. <em>MANJU SHIVACHARAN / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Undergraduate Student Government senate passed a new $3.2 million budget for the 2015-2016 year at its Thursday meeting by a vote of 15-2-0 after USG President Garry Lachhar vetoed an older version.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The senate extended the deadline to pass the budget to April 24 at an emergency meeting on April 15 after Lachhar vetoed the budget that the senate passed at its April 9 meeting. Lachhar said he vetoed the budget due to the large amount of money that was left in unallocated funds. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The original budget had over $200,000 in unallocated funds, compared to $52,966.23 for the 2014-2015 year. The new budget has less than $40,000 in unallocated funds.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">USG Treasurer Kathryn Michaud provided the senate with a breakdown of how much money was left unallocated. She emphasized the use of a key performance indicator (KPI) system to determine how much money each club was given.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Clubs that performed better than others were able to get more funds back,” she said. “The idea behind this was if you perform well, your club puts on more events and you show you know how to use everything properly, you’re more likely to put on larger better events next year because you know how to do it, you’re more likely to have better transitions, et cetera. So it made sense to invest in those clubs.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Michaud said other factors that affected KPI scores were Leadership Conference attendance, attendance at the other open forums and the number of vouchers submitted on time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Twenty-two clubs listed on the budget received no money for breaking the financial bylaws, not sending a representative to a budget hearing, handing in a budget applications late or not handing in an application at all.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The new budget also contained two new allocations: $65,000 for fall revisions and $60,000 for clubs that will be promoted to line budget status in the next academic year.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Under the fall revision process, clubs that applied for budgets but were cut by 50 percent or more will be able to apply for more funding during the fall semester.Clubs that did not apply for budgets will only be able to regain only up to 50 percent of the amount they received the previous year.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The new budget will cut Campus Recreation’s allocation from $167,952.88 to $138,396,88. The majors cuts were from funding for a boxing class and student attendants for fitness classes, Michaud said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Stony Brook Volunteer Ambulance Corps’s funding dropped from $139,000 to $114,000 as part of a plan to gradually decrease SBVAC funding to $40,000 for the 2018-2019 year.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In September 2013, the USG University and Academic Affairs Committee proposed a resolution that asked the university administration to take over the financing of SBVAC.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Senators raised the Residence Hall Association’s budget by $1,000 by a vote of 14-0-1. Sen. Lloyd Ippolito, the RHA president, said this raise is to account for an increase in resident students due to an expected doubling of tripled dorm rooms next year.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The new budget also raised the amount of money set aside for grants by $10,000. Michaud said this was to provide money for clubs to go to national conferences or events.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“If you have something on your line budget that you’re not definite to go to, that makes you able to get a national or regional event grant,” Michaud said. “So since you’re able to get those grants and that’s what that grant is actually designed for, that should not be allocated on the normal line budget. Since we cut a lot of those things out of the applications, we thought it was fair to put more money into the grant pool to help cover that.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Representatives of the cheerleading team came to the senate meeting to ask why their budget was cut by more than $7,000. Kristin McGinn, president of the team, said the team need the money for choreography and to go to a national championship competition.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“When we compete nationally, we’re received by tens of thousands of people across the country,” McGinn said. “There are hundreds of teams from different universities. Brothers and sisters and families are coming to watch us. We’ve had double, triple the amount of people trying out for our team, interested in coming to Stony Brook for our team. Now we need the proper coaching to be more successful at nationals.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lachhar and Sen. Marissa Peterson suggested that the Department of Athletics should help fund the cheerleading team, but McGinn said that the cheerleading team represents the entire university in outreach programs like hospital visits and breast cancer research fundraisers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We do all of that to support the community,” McGinn said. “We spend our time doing that, time we could be working or doing school work or anything like that. And nationals doesn’t just benefit us. It benefits the school, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">McGinn also said that the cheerleading team does not receive the perks of team-status under the Department of Athletics.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We’re just like any other club sport,” she said. “We’re not here on scholarship. We don’t get priority scheduling for classes.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Eventually the senate voted, 12-5-0, to increase the cheerleading team’s allocation by $6640.30.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One source of debate was over the decision of whether to increase funding for the Student Activities Board. The vetoed budget raised SAB funding by $40,000, but the new budget only raised funding by $10,000.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lachhar supported a bigger raise to help pay for large-scale on-campus events like concerts. “With both concerts having to be in the Arena now, instead of having one at Staller like we did last year, everything we spent was a lot more,” Lachhar said.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Michaud said a new grant can be created to help SAB fund on-campus events.</p>
<p class="p1">“The new type of grant that we’re trying to make is so that regular everyday student can come and they know that they’re able to come and put on an event and work with SAB to put it on efficiently,” she said.</p>
<p class="p1">But Lachhar said that rather than going through the grant pool, the money should just be put directly into SAB’s funds. “To say that $20,000 in the grant pool is going to be used to help SAB put on events is the same as putting the money in SAB,” he said. “But at least by moving the money over, SAB knows that it has that $20,000.”</p>
<p class="p1">In the end, Sen. Jan Jaminal’s motion to move $20,000 from the grant pool to SAB failed by a vote of 5-12-0.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The 2015 Undergraduate Student Government election debate hinged on the theme of experience versus originality among the PARTY Party,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the HOUSE Party and independent candidates on Wednesday night in the Student Union.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The PARTY (Proactive, Accessible, Responsible, Transparent and for You) Party’s executive council candidates consist of current USG senators and employees, as well as the current USG Executive Vice President and candidate for president, James Alrassi.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Like anybody who is involved with clubs on campus, it’s not something you get involved with for one year and then drop the next year,” Alrassi said. “The way I see USG is kind of my niche on campus. It’s where I feel comfortable. It’s where I feel really passionate. I wake up and the first thing I do when I get onto campus is grab my bacon, egg and cheese and then head up to my office.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">From the HOUSE (Holistic Opportunities Utilized for Student Equity) Party, Executive Vice President candidate Krisly Zamor, Treasurer candidate Naib Chowdhury and Vice President of Academic Affairs candidate Danielle Ali were not in attendance.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the HOUSE Party focused </span><span class="s1">its comments on the new outlook it plans to bring to USG.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I wanted to provide students with an alternative option this time around as opposed to last year when the USG elections were uncontested,” Cole Lee, the HOUSE Party presidential candidate and a USG senator, said. “I formed a party that is extremely diverse, club leaders, students leaders all across campus who know what the issues are and who speak with the students on a day to day basis.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The HOUSE Party plans to push for library hours to be extended to 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Alrassi said a 24/7 library would require an additional $3 million to make up for the 55 percent increase in staff hours.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Lee, who met with Division of Information Technology staff members, said “if students rally in support, the administration will provide the resources.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Nathan Blazon-Brown, the vice president of student life candidate for the PARTY Party, said his goal is to increase traditions on campus aside from the large-scale concerts.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It doesn’t just have to be concerts,” Blazon-Brown said. “It doesn’t just have to be shows. I think one of the things that we’re really lacking right now is traditions.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A source of controversy on the HOUSE Party platform is its plan to create USG-funded scholarships. Although it was previously said that using the Student Activity Fee for scholarships went against the SUNY Chancellor Guidelines, Lee found that USG scholarships are legal if awarded by the university’s administration and that he would plan to use unallocated funds in the USG budget.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Raisa Nishat, an independent candidate for vice president of clubs and organizations, found being unaffiliated with a party to be beneficial.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“For us to come in, it would kind of be like a new vibe I guess, something fresh, something new, maybe represent the student body in a different way than the people currently involved in USG,” Nishat said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Christopher Smith, an independent candidate for vice president of student life, also brought some new ideas, including a common area for students on campus.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I was at Staller about two weeks ago, there were a ton of people outside and it really hit home for me. There’s no real common area for students to hang out especially when it’s not nice out,” Smith said. “I think there should be some location where the student body can come together converge and foster a greater sense of community here at Stony Brook.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Freshman Elmer Flores, an independent candidate for vice president of clubs and organizations, showed enthusiasm for the position.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I’m trying to increase voter turnout,” Flores said. “I’m trying to increase participation of freshmen in USG, and the only position that freshmen can hold within USG that they actually get is probably the freshman rep. And by me running for this position I’m changing the dynamics of USG.”</span></p>

Since starting the season 3-7, the Seawolves have won 20 of their last 24 games and currently sit at 12-2 in the America East conference. Sophomore utilityman Casey Baker also had a slow start to the season, but has improved as the year has progressed and he has been recognized for his efforts.

Baker was awarded the America East Player of the Week award for this past week in recognition of his red-hot hitting in a 4-0 week for the Seawolves in which they took a midweek game against Central Connecticut before sweeping the Albany Great Danes in a weekend series in the state's capital.

Baker went 7-for-11 in that sweep of the conference rival in a 8-for-16 week for the Ronkonkoma native. Six of his eight hits went for extra bases, as he roped four doubles, a triple and his second home run of the season to give the Seawolves a 2-0 lead in game two of the series.

He also collected one RBI in each of the three games in the weekend series, increasing his total to five for the week. He also scored eight runs of his own.

His on base percentage was equal to his batting average at .500 and his slugging percentage escalated to 1.062 on the week.

Baker will look to lead the Seawolves into a crucial home stretch this week, as they play host to the Fairfield Stags on Wednesday afternoon at 3:30 p.m. before hosting the Hartford Hawks for a three-game set this weekend at Joe Nathan Field.]]></content:encoded>

" width="641" height="384" /></a> Stony Brook University student Will Hackett believes students should not vote for an Undergraduate Student Government candidate if they believe the candidates are not fit to fulfill the duties of the position. <em>PHOTO CREDIT: VOTE NO CONFIDENCE IN SBU USG FACEBOOK</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stony Brook University student Will Hackett started a “Vote No Confidence in SBU USG” Facebook event to encourage students to vote no confidence in the upcoming Undergraduate Student Government election, taking place from April 27 to May 1 on SOLAR.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“USG has not been serving the needs of the students and has major flaws,” Hackett said on the Facebook event’s description. “If you do not feel a candidate will change this system, you can vote ‘no confidence.’ The organization needs a people with a solid plan of action as to how they’re going to change it from the inside out.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Voting “no confidence” means the voter does not believe any of the candidates are fit to fulfill the duties of the position.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The event page has attracted 92 “attendees” and is encouraging student-voters to be aware of the fact that they have another option besides voting for a candidate or voting for no one. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“It’s not that I don’t want anyone to get voted in to USG,” Hackett said. “I want people who are going to go into USG and change it.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hackett said he has many issues with USG, including its alleged lack of transparency.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We don’t really know what the money is specifically being spent on,” Hackett said. “There should be a lot more transparency in the budget and USG in general.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hackett said he wanted to run for a position this year, but felt he did not have the time in his schedule to fully dedicate himself to USG. He is also a resident assistant in Toscanini College. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last year, every candidate for an Executive Council position ran unopposed. Hackett said if a student did not like the candidate, the student should not have to vote for the candidate or not vote at all; a third option should be there. He also said that the representatives do not represent the students they are supposed to.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“People should have the right to say they don’t support the way things are,” Hackett said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This Facebook event page has attracted the attention from current USG members as well. Mallory Rothstein, assistant to the current USG Vice President of Academic Affairs Steven Adelson and former USG executive vice president, shared her concerns about what would happen if the” no confidence” votes should surpass the votes for candidates.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“If no one gets elected, then there would have to essentially be another future election which would allow for a significantly less grace period for new officials to learn from past officials,” Rothstein said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rothstein also said that voting “no confidence” does not solve the problem of better candidates running because a good leader cannot be forced to run.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It will be up to the Elections Board if “no confidence” will appear on this year’s ballot. Historically, the option has not been on the ballot. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Current senators asked Hackett to share what would happen in the case positions do not get voted in, and he complied.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hackett does not want everyone to vote “no confidence;” he wants people to vote that way if they are unsatisfied with how things are being conducted within USG.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“My intent is not to have no USG next year,” Hackett explained. “Voting ‘no confidence’ gives us, as a student population, the opportunity to say we don’t like what’s going on.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

President Evgenia Sidorova, above, has overseen Stony Brook's GSO for two years, and is one of the few female leaders of the past 40 years. <em>PHOTO CREDIT: STONYBROOK.EDU</em>[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stony Brook University’s Graduate Student Organization has been acknowledged by the State University of New York for its efforts in encouraging female leadership. Stony Brook’s GSO, overseen by second-year president Evgenia Sidorova, was awarded by the SUNY Student Assembly for Commitment to Female Leadership and Empowerment on April 11.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We wanted to inspire girls at the graduate level,” Sidorova said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stony Brook is not the only SUNY school with a woman holding an executive position in its graduate student organization. The GSOs of SUNY’s four flagship universities—Binghamton, Buffalo, Albany and Stony Brook—are all run by a female president. These women inspired Lori Mould, the president of SUNY’s Student Assembly, Sidorova said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Lori saw our activities the past two years and wanted to recognize that,” Sidorova stated. “We set up different awards for females and highlight it on social media to get the information out. We have clubs and student leaders that try to inspire as well.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sidorova and GSO strive to empower young women to hold executive positions and promote diversity within the organization.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We wanted to make it diverse with people from different backgrounds and genders,” Sidorova said. “Over the last four to five years we have become very, very diverse with more females involved. We have added international and domestic students, males and females. This year I am the only international and the only female on the executive committee, but that is probably an exception.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sidorova is originally from Russia, but currently resides on Long Island. She is a second-year PhD candidate studying political science. She has made it a personal priority to involve graduate students in extracurricular activities. Her dedication to University Café, an on-campus eatery that hosts entertainment programs for students, alumni and faculty, encourages those involved to enhance their social lives at Stony Brook and helps to build a comfortable environment. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The University Café has been a great movement as we have entertainment programs all the time,” she mentioned. “This isn't just a commuter school, it’s a community.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sidorova recognized the challenges that graduate students face, who often have to balance a family with work and school. She noted that it's particularly difficult for women to find this balance and also be a successful leader.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Balancing family and a leadership career while also being the only woman in the room is a challenge,” Sidorova relayed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Having a different role at home than in the organization is a challenge,” she continued. “Do you wear a different mask?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sidorova said Stony Brook’s GSO hopes to break traditional views of women and help young women move beyond stereotypes by being a strong, capable leader. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I think that women are perceived as a weaker sex and that’s how they are treated,” Sidorova said. “If women are assertive they are considered to be rude or angry, too pushy or bossy. But if a man does this he is seen as a good leader. It’s very hard to be taken seriously.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sidorova knows these adversities from first-hand experiences. The entire GSO committee, except for Sidorova, is made up of men, and she is one of just a few female GSO presidents over the past 40 years. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I think that women are afraid they won’t be taken seriously by their advisers and that they will be bullied,” Sidorova said. “It’s also challenging because they are in graduate school and often have a family. I try to encourage them and open their eyes.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Despite her upcoming retirement from student government in two months, Sidorova said she hopes to continue inspiring women in her personal life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I think females already have all the qualities to be a leader,” she said. “To be a good leader you have to be empathetic. You have to be kind. Women have a lot of that. For women to be good leaders I think they need more encouragement from faculty and advisers.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Regardless of SUNY’s recognition of Stony Brook,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sidorova argues that women need more encouragement and more inclusion in executive positions. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We could do more, though,” Sidorova said. “I think everyone should be doing more to spread awareness.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The American Association for Cancer Research’s 106th Annual Meeting brought together 35,000 of the world’s leading cancer researchers, health care professionals and advocates to discuss advances in cancer research and the future of patient care.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The conference was overwhelming in size, with each day full of hundreds of different seminars, meetings, poster sessions and talks. The Philadelphia Convention Center buzzed with the energy of scientific discovery.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While advances in diagnosis and treatment have allowed over 14,500,000 cancer patients to live cancer free, millions of patients continue to struggle with their cancer. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The prevalence of cancer continues to rise in part because cancer cells have the ability to evolve to evade treatment. Cancer also differs in each patient. The word cancer encompasses hundreds of different diseases, with different causes, symptoms and treatments. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The theme of this year’s meeting was “Bringing Cancer Discoveries to Patients,” bridging the gap between scientists at the lab bench and patients in the clinic. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“This new era of cancer discovery is unprecedented with respect to rapidly emerging cancer science and new and effective targeted therapies,” Margaret Foti, the CEO of the association, said. “Today, molecular target approaches are being utilized based on a greater understanding of the biology of cancer.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An area of focus at the conference was immunotherapy, or harnessing the body’s own immune system to fight cancer. Several therapies are being developed that identify cancer cells as foreign or promote the aspects of the immune system that can destroy cancer cells. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Clinical trials conducted by Merck found that one drug, Pembrolizumab, was effective and safe for use in malignant mesothelioma and non small-cell lung cancer. The drug targets a protein expressed on tumor cells, and tumor immune cells, and has a better response rate and disease control rate than chemotherapy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pembrolizumab is just one of hundreds of drugs and potential treatments outlined at the conference. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Additionally, scientists at Vanderbilt University combined two powerful tools, mass spectrometry and microscopy, to create a revolutionary image fusion technique. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the first time, scientists can merge images to see the structure and molecular composition of tissue on one image, which has the potential to improve cancer diagnosis and treatment. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Image fusion utilizes the strengths of each technique.

For the fifth time this season, Stony Brook men’s lacrosse attackman Mike Rooney took home America East Player of the Week honors as he nears 100 points on the season.

The senior accounted for four goals and three assists in Friday’s 9-8 road win against Hartford. With the win, Stony Brook was able to clinch the number two seed in the America East tournament to close out the regular season, putting an end to one of the most dominant regular seasons in Stony Brook men’s lacrosse history.

Rooney, a native of East Islip on Long Island, is one of the most decorated lacrosse players to don Stony Brook’s red, white and blue. He is the program’s career leader in points and assists, and ranks third all-time in goals.

This season has been perhaps the best of his career. He tied with Albany’s Lyle Thompson for first in the NCAA with 6.13 points per game, with 98 total in the regular season. This has helped fuel Stony Brook’s powerhouse scoring offense, which ranks sixth in Division I in goals per game with an average of 14.06.

The Seawolves will open up their playoff schedule on Thursday in the America East semifinals against Vermont. If the team wants to go deep into the conference tournament as they seek an automatic berth in the NCAA tournament, they will need nothing short of a stellar performance from their leading scorer. A top-notch postseason performance from Rooney would likely bode well for Stony Brook’s postseason odds.]]></content:encoded>

It’s Britney, bitch.

Well no, it’s actually Brittany, and she’s better known quite tersely as Britt. Regardless, ESPN reporter Britt McHenry drew much ire after someone leaked a scandalous video showing her arguing with a female towing company worker. She received a one-week suspension, but many were left clamoring for a harsher punishment—a firing. I do not believe Britt McHenry should be fired for several reasons.

First of all, I said that the video featured Britt arguing with a worker. That is actually not true. We are not shown an argument. The video was purposely edited to only include the parts where McHenry was insulting the woman. We do not see what led up to this interaction, or what the worker was saying.

The leaked video is blatantly skewed to portray McHenry as a self-centered, condescending jerk. In fact, the only clear words we hear from the worker are her warning McHenry that she will show the security footage to other people, a statement clearly meant to antagonize the reporter further.

It logically does not make sense for anyone to support her termination without completely knowing the details surrounding the situation. The video does not provide enough to fully depict the scope of what happened.

Second, the actual comments that Britt made were not terrible. Let’s break down a couple of her utterances.

“That’s why I have a degree and you don’t.” Can this even be considered an insult? Steve Jobs and Bill Gates did not finish college, so she is putting the worker in the same category as two of the greatest minds the world has ever witnessed. “Lose some weight baby girl.” This was the comment that broke the camel’s back. However, we don’t know what the worker looked like. She could have legitimately been morbidly obese, and McHenry could have been genuinely concerned about the potential health risks such a condition would pose.

All kidding aside, McHenry’s comments were the typical, immature and condescending insults sometimes thrown about when one is engaged in a heated argument. The engagement seemed like a silly argument and nothing more.

Third, this incident occurred during McHenry’s personal time and not while she was actually working. She was not giving this woman an interview on opening day of baseball season and cursing her out on TV.

Now, let’s take Brian Williams. He lied on national television and has not been fired. Even though people are actually calling for him to be fired, the fact that he has not been should automatically prevent McHenry from getting fired. If a journalist for NBC can lie on a news program, then McHenry should be allowed to insult as many tow truck company workers as she wants to.

Fourth, we cannot ignore the massive elephant in the newsroom: when McHenry insulted the worker’s teeth and weight, the fact that she herself has perfect teeth and is in great shape made that insult worse. McHenry is an extremely attractive woman, and people do not like it when someone who is perceivably “superior” to another outlines that superior quality.

McHenry’s one-week suspension was ample punishment for her immature temper tantrum. She has since apologized for the outburst and explained that her emotions got the better of her, as I am sure we have all experienced ourselves. As long as she does not say “Oops, I did it again” anytime soon, I hope to see more of McHenry.]]></content:encoded>

ESPN suspended McHenry for a week following the leaked footage. <em>PHOTO CREDIT: KEITH ALLISON</em>[/caption]

There is a video floating around of ESPN sports reporter Britt McHenry being portrayed as something she probably thought she would never be—extremely ugly.

The video shows the 28-year-old going full Regina George on a towing company employee. McHenry was apparently trying to pick up her car from an attendant, but an altercation occurred between her and the employee. McHenry turned from polite to nasty real quick.

After the video went viral, ESPN took action and suspended McHenry for one week.

Nobody knows what happened leading up to the video, or if the parking attendant was egging her tantrum on. The video only shows a minute of McHenry in her hulk rage state against the parking employee and edits out any comments the employee made back.

Honestly though, I do not need to hear what was said leading up to her tirade because very few things could have justified what she said. Not only that, but receiving a one week suspension for her actions is a pathetic excuse for a punishment. McHenry should have been fired, and it should have happened a while ago.

The video opens with McHenry telling the employee, “I’m in the news sweetheart, I will f***ing sue this place.” Awesome. That is just the kind of pompous attitude you need when dealing with conflict.

The video cuts to her saying that she cannot stand being at this place because it makes her skin crawl. She accuses the attendant of only wanting to take people's money and having “no education and no skill set.” She even says that if she lost some teeth she could work at this place too. Before snatching up her papers and storming off, McHenry tells the employee to “lose some weight, babygirl.”

Before I rip McHenry a new one, I will say that yes, parking/towing companies everywhere have had a bit of a bad history with customer service. Anybody who has been to the DMV for more than five minutes contemplates murdering at least three people behind the counter. But in any of these blood boiling moments I never forget my civility, manners or how to act like a decent human being, something McHenry certainly cannot say for herself.

Being a reporter for ESPN Sports, McHenry has to understand the pros and cons of being in the spotlight. When that camera goes on and the players down on the field are being interviewed, the reporter on the scene is the face of the news channel that he or she represents. ESPN is too credible, and too smart for that matter, to not know that keeping McHenry is only going to hurt the appeal of their company. If Brian Williams, the long-time face of NBC, can be suspended for lying on camera, a sports reporter with little to no credibility should be fired.

Oh, and did I mention this is not the first time something like this has happened?

McHenry was involved in a similar disagreement online with a Twitter user. A female attorney tweeted about her disgust of sexualization of women in sports broadcasting saying, “I wish there were more women in sports broadcasting that aren’t completely sexualized.” McHenry replied to this by saying women can be both intelligent and beautiful. Both the original tweeter and other Twitter users hopped in saying that was not the intention of the attorney’s tweet.

To all this heat, McHenry replies, “You sound really bitter. Maybe if you work as hard as you say you do, you wouldn’t bash more successful people on Twitter.”

McHenry, babygirl, can you step off? I am pretty sure if there is ever a shortage of helium in this world, we can tap into McHenry’s brain. Did the world forget to tell her that starting fights over the internet stopped being acceptable in seventh grade? How many times is McHenry’s temper going to get the better of her, only to have her actions brushed off?

I do not want to be one of those people that tries to ruin someone’s life over nothing. McHenry’s job is a dream for many people, and if messed up, there are not often second chances.

But McHenry crossed a serious line. She was aware that she was on camera, and that what she was saying was uncalled for, but she said it anyway. She did not only call out the employee for doing her job incorrectly, but also deliberately belittled her looks, her intelligence and the employee as a person.

If McHenry is as smart as she claims, then she would have known that she cannot be a popular public figure while acting like this. I just hope ESPN is smart enough to realize this too.]]></content:encoded>

Hey movie-goers!

Between keeping up with your favorite college-girl a cappella group, watching Reese Witherspoon play a cop and adventuring into Disney's Tomorrowland, the big screen has something for everyone.

Here are some movies to look out for with release dates in May.

1) In the movie "Hot Pursuit," Witherspoon plays Cooper, a cop who has not yet been able to prove herself in her field. She gets the job of accompanying a superior officer to transport a witness to testify in court against drug dealers. As she is picking up the witness Daniella, played by Sofia Vergara, their location is attacked and the two ladies must escape together, with Daniella under Cooper's protective custody. Cooper must do what she can to keep Daniella safe. The movie hits theaters May 8.

2) The girls are back and are ready to tackle an international competition in "Pitch Perfect 2." The same hilarious and quotable cast hits the big screen once more as they attempt to win an international a cappella competition that no American group has won before. The group's bond is stronger than ever as the girls try to achieve their goal, with some good music and comedy along the way. The girls hit the stage again on May 15.

3) Are you a Disney fan? The concept of one of Disney's most well-known attractions is explored in the movie "Tomorrowland." George Clooney plays a science genius who enters another dimension with a curious teenager, played by Britt Robertson, where their actions can potentially save the Earth from the current issues that are destroying it. The adventure begins May 22.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_39863" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="size-full-width wp-image-39863" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/PhotoCredit_MeganMiller_Money-600x359.jpg" alt="MEGAN MILLER / THE STATESMAN" width="600" height="359" /> United States bills currently do not have any female faces on them. The issue received national attention in the past few months with "The Women On 20s" campaign to get a female on the $20 bill after President Obama addressed the issue in a speech. <em>MEGAN MILLER / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

The last few months have seen a rise in support for a change of face in American currency. Bills have been proposed in both the <a href="http://time.com/3830613/congressman-illinois-woman-american-currency/" target="_blank">House</a> and the <a href="http://www.shaheen.senate.gov/news/press/release/?id=05739d4a-bb0e-4724-a49a-031aa0797fd3" target="_blank">Senate</a> after President Obama said in a speech that a nine-year-old girl wrote him a letter regarding the lack of women on paper money.

Activists have made their target known, and it is the $20 bill, which currently features a portrait of a wild-haired Andrew Jackson.

The Women On 20s campaign has gained considerable traction and is in the midst of conducting an unofficial online poll. The finalists are Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, Eleanor Roosevelt and Wilma Mankiller. An abolitionist, a civil rights activist, an influential first lady and a Cherokee chief, respectively.

I am partial to Parks. Racism is often considered a product of past times, but racial conflict and the grating of historic tensions are more relevant now than they have been in years. Adding Parks into circulation could serve as a reminder of how things were and how things need to be if development is to continue.

Of all the men who helped shape our nation, and were rewarded with their portraits plastered on our currency, Jackson is easily the least deserving.

Often in the modern world, we look back on our predecessors and allow for a learning curve. We forgive Bill Clinton for signing the Defense of Marriage Act and for enacting the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy. We have accepted the fact that George Washington and Thomas Jefferson owned slaves. Henry Ford and Walt Disney were anti-Semites, but Jewish people buy their products.

Andrew Jackson does not belong in this category of necessary evils.

He was a racist, warmongering and greedy plantation owner who became president and destroyed the lives of thousands in the name of American expansion.

Jackson assumed the presidency in 1829 and immediately became the people’s president. He was the first president to invite the public to his inauguration ball. He came from a log cabin in Tennessee and became the most famous war hero to emerge out of the War of 1812, after his victories in the Battle of New Orleans.

A self-made man, his path to the White House would have been an honorable and intriguing one if he had not made his money buying and selling hundreds of slaves. And the kicker is that his plantation was on land that had previously been set aside for Native Americans. How is that for foreshadowing?

While it is unlikely a reasonable, fair and peaceful resolution would have ever been reached, Jackson expedited the inevitable conflict between the native North American population and Manifest Destiny rather cruelly. His actions can be looked at as the point of no return for the relationship between our still developing nation and the Native American populace.

Jackson forcibly removed tens of <a href="http://www.nps.gov/trte/learn/historyculture/stories.htm" target="_blank">thousands</a> of Choctaw, Cherokee and Seminole Native Americans, including several thousand slaves, from their homes in Florida, Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi. Most of them walked the 2,000 miles on the Trail of Tears to Oklahoma. If they survived the trek, their children and grandchildren would, in all likelihood, later be forcibly removed again.

Jackson was not solely responsible for the persecution of Native Americans, nor was he the worst person to ever walk this earth. However, he was not just a product of his times. He was, for all intents and purposes, a monster who dehumanized his fellow human beings to the point of genocide and enslavement.

This is hardly a man worth celebrating or memorializing.

Putting a black woman on the $20 bill will probably not make a dent in the immense amount of work our country still has to do across the board. Not to mention our currency will serve as recognition for someone who was not a rich white male.

Not that rich white men have not done a lot for our country. They have just also done a pretty good job of making sure they were the only ones available for the job.]]></content:encoded>

This year’s Earthstock Festival made its mark with the recyclable materials, food, animals and the various performances. The one show that stood out this year was the Color Guard and Drumline Showcase.The showcase was held at the Staller Steps at 3:30 p.m. on Friday, April 24.

The main entertainers were the Stony Brook Marching Band’s color guard and drumline.Over 50 Stony Brook students came to the Staller Steps to watch the groups perform on the cloudy and environmentally-friendly day.The drumline started the show with the song “Pompeii,” which fired up the Stony Brook students who gathered on the steps.

Both color guard and drumline switched off performing throughout the entire showcase.

“[The Showcase] gives them the opportunity to focus on their technique,” Shayna Stahl, the director of the Athletic Bands, said.

Members of the color guard started their performance by taking out their flags and dancing to songs like “Price Tag” and “Heartless” by Jessie J and Kanye West, respectively.  The color guard members choreographed all of their routines.

Elizabeth Brenner choreographed two of her members for the 12th number in the showcase. One routine from the color guard that stood out in the showcase was the “Pirates of the Caribbean” performance. Jake Holderman and Caitlyn Forrester-Johnson’s performance embodied two pirates in the midst of a sword fight.

Color guard and the drumline did have one obstacle during the show: the weather.

It was a cold and windy day, which brought difficulty to some of the performances. During the 11th and 14th act, while the color guard members were dancing and waving their flags, the wind started to blow the flags away, causing the performers to drop them. However, they were able to pick them up and continue to impress the crowd with their talent.

Stahl and all of the other captains organized the entire showcase.

The other people who organized this event were Greg Mulzet, the coordinator of athletic bands; Mark Carmen, the drumline instructor; and the color guard captains. The marching band closed the show with two final numbers from both the drumline and color guard.

Despite the dropping of a couple of the flags during their routine, the performance was still impressive and the crowd responded well, making it known that they were entertained.

The drumline closed the show with songs from “LTL” to “D&amp;K.” After the performance, the group received a big round of applause. The performers had to deal with chilling winds, but the performances made their mark on this year’s Earthstock festival.]]></content:encoded>

HEATHER KHALIFA / THE STATESMAN" width="600" height="400" /> Ahmad Walker, above, averaged seven points and 5.3 rebounds per game in his freshman year at Stony Brook. <em>HEATHER KHALIFA / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

What was first reported by <a href="http://seawolvesnation.kinja.com/reports-ahmad-walker-is-transferring-back-to-stony-bro-1700617452?rev=1430221068704" target="_blank">Seawolves Nation</a> has now been confirmed by Stony Brook Athletics: <a href="http://sbstatesman.com/tag/ahmad-walker/" target="_blank">Ahmad Walker</a> is back.

The six-foot-four-inch 175-pound wing will transfer back to Stony Brook University in the fall. Walker spent two years as a Seawolf before transferring to Barton Community College of the National Junior College Athletic Association last June.

Walker redshirted his first year at Stony Brook during the 2012-2013 season before impressing in his freshman campaign, starting in all but three games of the 2013-2014 season.

He feasted defensively and was a standout athlete, able to leap among the trees and finish through traffic. At Barton, Walker averaged 20.6 points, 7.7 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game on 51.5 percent shooting from the field in 27 games. A year removed from Division I basketball, Walker will be competing for playing time with sophomore guards Roland Nyama, Bryan Sekunda, Deshaun Thrower and junior Kameron Mitchell.

Walker now returns to secure the last scholarship spot on the Seawolves roster, which is available thanks to junior forward Scott King and sophomore forward Chris Braley <a href="http://sbstatesman.com/2015/03/25/scott-king-chris-braley-transfer/" target="_blank">signing their release letters</a> last month.

It is still unclear why Walker originally transferred out of Stony Brook after the 2013-2014 season.

Renowned astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson spoke about the practicality of accumulating a “library” of knowledge and experiences during his talk Monday night for the 35th anniversary of the Stony Brook Graduate Student Organization.

Over 2,600 people packed into the Island Federal Credit Union Arena to hear Tyson summarize his journey from Bronx nerd to director of the Hayden Planetarium to Twitter and television celebrity. His secret? Following his natural passion.

“There are these things I did in life that I simply enjoyed,” Tyson said.

His favorite endeavors included turning his bathroom into a photography lab, buying his first telescope with money made from walking dogs and visiting Stonehenge.

“These joys of mine found ways to manifest, and I'm reminded of what a library is,” Tyson said. “So I remember thinking when I was growing up, I want to know as much as I can about as many things, because I don’t know later on what I’m going to draw on.”

From that advice, Tyson dove into a number of humorous stories about his life, including when he was relieved of his jury duty for questioning the reliability of eyewitness accounts. But he especially expressed how his passion fueled him to success from a young age, even when the academic system estimated otherwise.

Tyson said his fourth and fifth-grade teachers would say on his report cards that he was too social or needed more school work. Tyson replied by arguing that being social or being a mediocre student is not a bad thing, because academics are rarely a true indication of one’s worth. So when his elementary school noted his growth later on and called him back for a speech, he had powerful words for them.

“I am where I am not because of you but in spite of you,” Tyson exclaimed, drawing laughter and clapping from the crowd. “At the end of the day, if you’re going to assess the promise and performance of someone by their GPA when they have the rest of their life to lead, you’re going to be missing some people for sure.”

To help make his point, Tyson called up Stony Brook University President Samuel L. Stanley Jr. to the stage to ask him, “When’s the last time someone asked what your GPA was?” When President Stanley said it’s been a long time, Tyson said, “Exactly!”

Vice President of GSO Max Katz said Tyson’s name was thrown around a lot as a potential speaker because he exemplifies Stony Brook’s goals as a research institution.

“He’s a very good scientist, but he’s also very good at connecting with people and finding ways in pop culture to connect what’s going on in science to that,” Katz said. “That’s why I think he best captures what we’re all about here.”

Sophomore computer science major Gustavo Poscidonio said his favorite characteristic of Tyson’s is his charisma and how he can bring science even to those who have no scientific background.

“I think he’s got this crazy ability to simplify the most extraordinary scientific concepts,” Poscidonio said. “I think it was Einstein who said ‘if you can’t explain it simply you don’t know it well enough’ and I think he understands it well enough.”

Stanley commended GSO for their hard work in getting Tyson to come to Stony Brook and had similar feelings about his appeal.

“I think he takes a look at a lot of issues and approaches them in a really rational and thoughtful way,” Stanley said. “I also appreciate the fact that he’s a champion for science and for bringing science to the masses to help them understand it and appreciate how amazing this universe is.”

But as Tyson said over and over in his speech, science is not about answers. In fact, he said conclusions are just the “tip of the tip of the iceberg” in the scientific community. His passion for science is not attributed to the discovery of the what, but the pursuit of the why and how.

“You need to love the act of doing it,” Tyson said. “That’s what science is, the investigation.”]]></content:encoded>

(KRYSTEN MASSA / THE STATESMAN)" width="600" height="450" /> Popcorn toffee bars can be made a few days in advance and stored in an airtight container at room temperature. <em>KRYSTEN MASSA / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

Looking for something quick and easy to whip up for when your friends come over? College Gal’s rendition of a popcorn toffee crack bar is the perfect combination of salty and sweet that will be good for any occasion.

Ingredients:

Vegetable oil spray

15 graham crackers

Four cups of popped popcorn

Pretzels

¾ cup of puffed rice cereal

1½ cups of of unsalted butter

¾ cups of sugar

1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips

Sea salt

First, preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.

Line a large baking sheet with tinfoil and coat it with non-stick cooking spray. Place the graham crackers across the entire cooking sheet and top them with popcorn, pretzels and puffed rice cereal.

Put the butter and sugar in a  medium sauce pan and cook on medium heat to bring to a boil. Once the mix is boiling, lower the heat to a simmer and swirl the mixture occasionally until it turns a golden brown color with a syrup-like consistency.

This process should take around 8-10 minutes.

Once this is done, pour this toffee creation over the graham crackers. Bake this for about 10 to 12 minutes until the toffee coating is slightly darkened to a nice brown color. As the bars cook, you will begin to notice the sweet scent in the air.

Remove the pan from the oven and top the bars with the chocolate chips so they melt into the other ingredients. If you want, sprinkle some sea salt on top for some more flavor.

Let this cool for a few minutes and then you are ready to break it up and pass it around.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Albany again stands in the way of a men&#039;s lacrosse conference title</title>

On the far east end of Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium, a men’s lacrosse player slowly pranced from near the sideline towards the goal crease, no urgency in his steps.

The clock was ticking down, ten seconds and counting, yet calm as can be, that student-athlete made his move and tied the America East semifinals, before his team beat Stony Brook to end the
Seawolves’ season.

That player just happens to be Lyle Thompson, Albany’s All-World attackman who has returned after his Co-Tewaaraton Award winning season to lead his Great Danes on another postseason run.

Albany will likely be the toughest barricade for the Seawolves to knock over if they are to win the America East Tournament and advance to the NCAA Tournament.

The Great Danes broke Stony Brook’s hearts with a gut-wrenching overtime win in last year’s conference semis, but this year’s Seawolves team is different.

The squad will look to finish what it started last season with a semifinal matchup against Vermont on Thursday at 4:30 p.m. at SUNY Albany.

The Seawolves trounced the Catamounts in Burlington earlier this season, as senior attackman Mike Rooney’s 11 points led the way in the team’s 21-12 win after bursting out to a 13-4 halftime lead.

It is not a shock that Rooney went off for double digits, as he leads the country in points with 98 and is second in the nation behind Thompson in points per game.

Stony Brook’s season on a whole can only be summed up with one phrase—record-breaking. The Seawolves look to continue doing just that as they head into the America East Tournament this week.

A year ago, Head Coach Jim Nagle’s team won six games, including a stunning loss to eventual NCAA Quarterfinalist Albany in the America East Tournament semifinals.

With pretty much the same squad back, minus a transfer to Duke and the injury bug throughout the year, the Seawolves came out swinging, winning 12 games on the year.

If the team should go on to win the America East Championship, they will break the program’s record for wins set by a Kevin Crowley-led 2010 team that lost in the NCAA Quarterfinals, 10-9, to Virginia.

So, how has a squad with almost no change doubled its win total and performed so much better with their backs against the wall?

As Nagle and his team said before the season started, the Seawolves bought in during the offseason, putting in the work and doing whatever it takes to win.

In one year, the program records for career points, points in a season, career assists and assists in a season have all fallen and done so at the hands of one student-athlete: Rooney.

The Long Island native has risen to the occasion, especially when the team has needed it most.

Stony Brook defeated Fairfield by merely one goal earlier in the season, with Rooney coming up with seven points on the day.

Recently against Binghamton, he added nine points in a big overtime win.

Without his poise, those outcomes may not have been the same.

Junior attackman Brody Eastwood has quietly skated by while having arguably the most prolific scoring seasonin team history.

He broke the records for goals in a game and season while steadily sitting in second in goals per game in the country.

That does not even take into account arguably the most unselfish performance of all coming from possibly the most talented of all the Seawolves, junior midfielder Challen Rogers.

His effort and impact may not show on the stat sheet, but for a midfielder to shoot 47 percent is unreal, and the slides he draws opens plays up for his teammates.

What does this all mean? The Seawolves have been doing great things individually, but while some teams may see that negatively impact the overall result, it has only come together to produce one of the best overall team seasons at Stony Brook this year, during which the squad has spent much time in the national rankings.

There is one problem, and it happens to be a very, very big one: If the Seawolves should advance to the America East finale, they will more than likely face a team that sits in the country’s top-10 in Albany.

Thompson is not only the best player in college lacrosse, but possibly one of the best in the world. He answered any and all questions about whether he could play without brother Miles and cousin Ty, who both graduated last season from Albany.

Thompson broke Rob Pannell’s NCAA career points record and unselfishly led the country’s most prolific offense with a group that he had little to no experience with before the first face-off of the year was held.

As well as Stony Brook can play, proving that the team can hang with anybody when it went into halftime against two-time defending National Champion Duke only down by two goals, it will come down to playing a clean enough game against the Great Danes so that the Seawolves will not have to play catch-up.

Looking to make a comeback against such a dynamic offense will only spell disaster for the Seawolves.

A lot of that will start at the face-off “x,” where sophomore Jay Lindsay and junior Frank Lucatuorto have filled in nicely for Kyle Rowe, who joined his brother Jack at Duke.

As the season has gone along, both players, but especially Lindsay, have excelled in the ground ball game, a soft spot for the team as a whole in the past, and one of the most vital aspects of lacrosse.

Time and time again this year Stony Brook has found itself in tough situations, and it has been winning that key face-off, stealing that messy ground ball or making the right pass at the right time that has allowed the team to dig in and win games that it may not have won last season.

If the Seawolves do indeed beat the Catamounts, they will play the winner between the Great Danes and the Hartford Hawks on Saturday morning at 10 a.m in Albany.]]></content:encoded>

The Stony Brook women’s lacrosse team has gone from setting out to prove people wrong to proving itself right this season, as the team enters the America East Championships on Friday evening as the top seed and a nationally-ranked top-five powerhouse, playing UMBC in the semifinals at Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium at 5 p.m.

The Seawolves were not always a shoe-in to earn their third straight top seed for the America East Tournament, as Stony Brook entered the year without its loudest voice and strongest defense. Superstar-goalkeeper Frankie Caridi graduated in the spring. Her departure naturally left a void. Yet, as April nears its end, the Seawolves find themselves not only just as good as they were last season, but even better.

Rankings do not always speak truth, but the top-five Seawolves are among the nation’s elite, whether they have the number next to the team’s name or not. Last year’s suffocating defense has returned, despite losing key pieces, but the biggest change, as Head Coach Joe Spallina noted before the year got going, was the dynamic offense that Stony Brook possesses.

Any student-athlete on the squad can be the star on any given night, and one can pretty much pick the sophomores Courtney Murphy and Dorrien Van Dyke, senior Michelle Rubino, freshman Kylie Ohlmiller or others out of a hat as performer of the game and nobody would truly be surprised.

In the America East Tournament and beyond, having everyone ready and able to contribute will be of the utmost importance. It is inevitable that a team will scout Stony Brook and slide to Murphy on one day, or throw a double-team at Ohlmiller on another. If the Seawolves keep the ball moving fluidly, someone will be open, and it will be the receiver of the pass’ job to finish the sequence off.

Despite their elite defense, the Seawolves will need to keep up what they showed they could do on the offensive end all season long. The Albany Great Danes, the only other America East team that is nationally ranked, happens to have one of the most potent attacks in the country.

Led by Maureen Keggins, the nation’s leader in points per game, the Great Danes have averaged nearly 15 goals per game. Yet, Stony Brook managed to stifle the squad when the teams played at LaValle Stadium back in April. Albany only came away with five goals on the day, and if they should end up facing the Seawolves for the title, they will be looking for revenge.

First, though, the Seawolves will have to get by UMBC, the team that Stony Brook beat 13-7 earlier in the season, clinching hosting rights for the conference tournament in doing so.

Coming off of a big win over seven-time National Champion Northwestern, the Seawolves’ game against the Retrievers was a spot that one may expect a team to lose focus. However, a strong first half propelled the Seawolves to the win, as five members of Spallina’s group scored two or more goals in a total team effort.

It cannot be said enough that even though Stony Brook has proven everybody wrong by putting together arguably the best season in the history of Seawolves Athletics, many people still underestimate the depth of this team. Last season, it was all Murphy and Van Dyke, with Rubino doing the two-way work. This year, those who rarely see the field can pitch in just as well.

Sophomore Kristin Yevoli and senior Amber Kupres would fit in as strong offensive forces on any other team in the conference, yet they have combined for “just” 27 goals and four assists on the season. That is a testament to the pure talent the Seawolves have.

Again, freshman Samantha DiSalvo may have an underwhelming total of seven points on her young career, yet she has proven that if necessary, she can run onto the field and do her part.

What is concerning and could cause problems is if the Seawolves fall behind in the second half. This causes the draw control to become as important as ever.

Stony Brook has shown improvement not only from last season but throughout this campaign as well, but the team is still 93rd in the country in that department. There is no truly weak position on this team that warrants a lack of confidence, but if Spallina’s squad has a must-win draw late in a game, will it be able to control? That is not an easy call.

If the Seawolves hang tough at the circle against their America East foes, there will be no problems. Stony Brook has the best defense and the most talented offense in the league.

However, the likelihood of that happening for the two-time defending conference champions is slim. After suffering their only loss of the year to Johns Hopkins, the Seawolves have learned their lesson of not going into a game with their guard down.

Even though Stony Brook will get into the NCAA Tournament with or without the America East’s automatic bid, they will be looking to head to the national tournament with momentum.]]></content:encoded>

The Seawolves would go on to beat the Fairfield Stags 15-3.<em> BASIL JOHN / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

For the 14th time in 15 games, Stony Brook baseball has emerged the victor.

The Seawolves tied a season-high in runs scored on Wednesday, as they won a lopsided home game against Fairfield by a score of 15-3.

"Our team has taken our play to a high level," Seawolves Manager Matt Senk said. "We're playing a complete game."

Coming out of the gate, Stony Brook wasted no time scoring against Fairfield pitcher Gavin Wallace. After senior catcher Cole Peragine led off the first inning with a walk, senior outfielder Jack Parenty ripped a triple to deep center, giving the Seawolves their first run of the day. An ensuing single by freshman infielder Malcom Nachmanoff drove home Parenty to give the Seawolves a 2-0 lead.

The second inning was even more productive for Stony Brook. Parenty got another chance to do damage with the bases loaded and two outs, and did not squander the opportunity. He doubled in two runs to increase the lead to 4-0. Once again, Nachmanoff followed Parenty with a bases clearing single to make it 6-0.

"I just got a couple of good pitches to hit," Parenty said of his two extra base hits.

Wallace would not even get a chance to finish the third inning. After allowing two hits and a walk to the first three batters of the third, he was pulled in favor of sophomore lefty Ryan O'Connor. Wallace finished the day with a nightmarish line, allowing eight runs on eight hits in just two innings of work.

"Our offense did a terrific job today," Senk said.

Even with its beleaguered starter pulled, Fairfield could not quell the Seawolves’ hot bats. Stony Brook scored nine runs over the game’s final seven innings, scoring at least one run in each inning, save for the eighth.

“We carried over [offensive success from past games] into today,” Parenty said. “We’re just going to keep doing what we’re doing.”

As it dominated at the plate, Stony Brook impressed on the mound as well. Starting pitcher Tim Knesnik had arguably his best outing of the season, allowing just one hit in five scoreless innings while striking out six batters.

"I was throwing my fastball for strikes a lot more," Knesnik said. "The fact that our offense was killing the ball also [gave me] a lot of confidence."

After Knesnik was pulled, the Seawolves used some of their less-experienced underclassmen to finish the game in relief. Aaron Pinto, Cole Creighton and Joseph Guercio combined to allow three runs on seven hits over the game’s final four innings. For this trio of relievers, it marked their fifth, sixth and third appearances on the season, respectively.

"[Pinto, Creighton and Guercio] did a good job of getting out there and going after hitters," Senk said. "Overall, I was pleased with our pitching performance today."

Stony Brook will wrap up its final homestand of the season this weekend with a pivotal three-game America East series against Hartford. As they hold a four-game conference lead with ten games to go, it will be crucial for the Seawolves to capitalize on their home turf.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Stony Brook came back from a pair of deficits and Matt Senk earned his 700th career victory, in a 6-4 defeat of LIU Brooklyn in an NCAA baseball non-conference matchup Wednesday afternoon.

Andruw Gazzola went 2-for-4 and earned a pair of RBI while Toby Handley had a clutch one-out, two-run double as the Seawolves defeated the Blackbirds in the first matchup between the two teams since 2001.

This victory makes it seven wins in a row for the Seawolves. The streak dates back to early April, with the Seawolves' last loss coming on March 30.

“It beats the alternative,” Senk said with a laugh. “It’s great to take that streak into the Georgetown weekend.”

Handley’s double in the sixth inning was a hot shot down the left-field line, scoring Cole Creighton from second and Cole Peragine all the way from first to give the Seawolves a 5-4 lead, an advantage they would not relinquish over the final three frames.

It was one of Senk’s former players that he defeated, taking down Stony Brook baseball’s first All-American and current LIU Brooklyn Head Coach Alex Trezza. Trezza played from 1999-2002, and was picked to College Baseball Newspaper’s Third Team in 2001 to earn the landmark.

“He’s doing a very good job there and has them playing hard. It was a hard-fought game,” the manager said about Trezza.

It was Nick DiEva who started the matchup, going three innings, with the first inning going roughly.

The freshman hit his first batter and then allowed a Tommy Jakubowski triple two batters later to get the Blackbirds on the board early. An RBI groundout by Melvin Rios made it 2-0 LIU Brooklyn.

Jakubowski would score another run in the fourth when he reached on an infield single and later touched home on Mark Hernandez’s sacrifice fly. The big-hitting lefty finished the night 2-for-3.

DiEva was able to record five strikeouts in the short outing, three of them looking with a nasty curveball.

“His stuff was really good,” Senk said. “He throws hard and his breaking ball was good.”

Three straight base hits by Johnny Caputo, Gazzola and Jeremy Giles gave the Seawolves their first lead of the game at 3-2 in the third. Gazzola’s triple down the right field line was sandwiched between RBI singles up the middle by Caputo and Giles.

Jakubowski’s run tied it, then Hernandez gave LIU a 4-3 lead with a bomb over the right-center field fence off of Tim Knesnik in the seventh, Hernandez's second RBI of the game.

After Creighton and Peragine were able to draw free passes via a hit by pitch and a walk, Handley roped a 3-2 pitch down the left field line to score them both.

Those were two of 11 free passes issued by Blackbird pitchers with three hit by pitches, two of them to Creighton, and eight walks.

“Our guys have been really good at [drawing free passes] all year,” Senk said. They have amassed 134 free passes to 199 strikeouts. “Their patience and strike zone discipline has been really good most of the year.”

Just to ice the victory, Gazzola drew a bases loaded walk to score Peragine in the eighth, who also reached on a base on balls.

The Seawolves will look to extend their winning streak when they take their talents to the nation’s capital and Big East country to take on Georgetown in a three-game set this weekend.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Let’s clear up a few things. I’m not an Apple hater, nor am I an Apple fanatic. I do use an iPhone, purely for its simplicity. That is what Apple products are known for and that is what the soon-to-be-released Apple Watch is not known for.

What do you really need in a watch? Well, let’s first define the word “watch” (noun).

Based on Merriam-Webster Dictionary, the word means, “a device that shows what time it is and that you wear on your wrist or carry in a pocket.”

The Apple Watch does fit in the definition, and its other excessive features are unnecessary.

I compiled a list of five reasons why you shouldn’t buy the Apple watch:

1. Price: The Apple Watch starts at $349. This is actually absurd because the Apple Watch costs almost twice as much as a new iPhone 6 from AT&amp;T.

The base price is for the Apple Watch Sport. There are other options such as the Apple Watch (wow, such a creative model name) starting at $549 and the Apple Watch Edition, featuring an 18-karat gold case, starting as low as $10,000.

Really? You might as well buy six 1oz gold bars and a cheap JC Penney Casio wristwatch, because that seems like a million times better and wiser investment. Oh, and it is cheaper to do so.

2. Convenience: The Apple Watch can only be used with the iPhone to activate all of its features. Great! You can now answer your iPhone from your watch, because Apple knows you are too lazy to reach through your pocket when you receive a call from someone.

3. Charging: Seriously?! Who in their right mind had the concept of charging a watch?

If you’re like me, you probably have a ton of adapters for all your contraptions like your phone, laptop, speakers, fan, trimmer, your other fan, etc.

What sane person would agree to have an unnecessary adapter, especially for a watch, in addition to the current collection they already have?

4. Practicality: It shows time. You already have a phone that shows time.

Not only does it show time but it takes and receives calls, gives directions, tracks your health, download apps and stores music. It also fits conveniently right in your pocket.

Why would you want some other accessory which, in fact, accessorizes your phone that does the same thing (and, most likely less, at that)?

5. Necessity: Not only is it a horrible investment for you, but it’s also a cruel one.

There are children around the world that barely have barely anything to eat while you raise an exultant smile when that Apple employee hands you your new apple Watch.

You’d be less abominable if you threw $349 on the street.

Anyway, do not buy the Apple Watch! It will be a waste of money that, honestly, could be spent much more wisely.]]></content:encoded>

As the movie begins, Clint Eastwood is lining up the camera and ready to start filming. Amy Adams comes out of her trailer, looking like that daughter Eastwood never had. Justin Timberlake is ready to start filming like he is actually Scott Eastwood. All goes well on set until the technical director asks Eastwood, “How do you use this camera again?”

While the movie “Trouble with the Curve” was pretty alright, what is happening with students in colleges is just absurd.

I like to call it “trouble with the curve” as well, but this concerns the ridiculous grading curve used nationwide. The real question is, are we hand-holding students too much? This is a problem that has driven studies across the globe, specifically in the U.S. While many Americans boast the most ridiculous of claims that we are the best country in the world, we continue to fall in terms of global education rankings at an astonishing rate. Now, as we stand at <a href="http://thelearningcurve.pearson.com/index/index-ranking" target="_blank">14th</a> in the world in terms of global education, we are at a crossroads with how we should decide our future. Should we rely on other countries or should we take control of our youth and really start educating our people to change the world? I will not bother with questions of the future here, but the most important question we can ask ourselves is, “Is this grading curve worth the price we pay for education?” The answer is clearly no. There is no benefit whatsoever to a student failing a test and still passing due to a ridiculous grading curve.

It truly is one of the most puzzling things in education. For example, just last semester I got a 56 on a midterm but passed with a B. How does that happen? I apparently knew 56 percent of the information, but that merits that I finished way above the average. This sort of discrepancy is alarming.

The real problem with grading curves are the professors teaching the curved classes. I understand there is not much the individual professor can do to change the material, but what benefit is it to a student to have a test so difficult that no matter how hard he studies, he is sure to fail?

I think it is time students start revolting against the curve. The trouble is on the university’s end, but the acceptance that students have for curved classes is equally disturbing. Does anyone actually feel good getting a 50 on a test? Is that test really the best way to teach a student? This means that some students waste their money by paying professors to teach them nothing, yet curve them to pass courses.

Students do not learn if they get saved, and as a student myself, I would rather have a teacher tell me how I can be better than tell me “Oh, you hit average, you are fine.” This backwards mentality is destroying American education. When a student accepts his fate and rides the average to a B and when a professor makes a test so hard that not one student passes, you know there is a problem with the education system.

Professors have to be better. They have to teach better. They have to really prove to students that they will test them on what is reviewed in class and not just their backward examples of “critical thinking.”

Students have to be better. They have to behave better. We have to stop accepting the fact curves will save our college careers and start putting accountability on ourselves to learn material and actually try to be better.

I can guarantee that when that technical director lines up for a shot on a major motion picture, he would rather have been taught how to use the camera then how to critically apply the knowledge that a camera exists but now you need to find how many apples Jane had. Everyone needs to come together to understand the “Trouble with the Curve” applies to everyone’s future and not just passing college classes.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When I was younger, my mother talked to me about sperm, eggs and how fertilization makes a baby. Being the junior scientist/future sex columnist that I was, I wondered about how the sperm found the egg. Did it have a map or something? This conversation made my mother uncomfortable, so we did not talk about it.

That is what people do; we avoid things that make us uncomfortable. That is why I avoid baked beans, Crocs and romantic comedies that star Katherine Heigl. Unfortunately, this is the same mindset that prevents us from discussing rape. I know most people find the word “rape” uncomfortable and so avoid talking about it. I would like to bring to light the fact that it is much more uncomfortable to be raped than it is to talk about it. I also know this does not make it any easier to talk about. I avoided telling anyone about my rape for too long and was not able to prosecute it as a result. But as long as rape happens, we are going to have to talk about it. And now is a good time to start.

According to <a href="http://www.oneinfourusa.org/statistics.php" target="_blank">oneinfourusa.org</a>, “One in four college women report surviving rape or attempted rape at some point in their lifetime.” Seriously consider this for a moment: A female college student might have a better chance of not dying in a game of Russian Roulette than she does of not being raped. In a freshman suite (which usually contains seven people), two of those girls will likely be raped. In your lecture class in Javits 100, estimates would say that everyone is sitting in a room with approximately 100 possible victims of rape.

When many people think of rape, they imagine a woman in a short skirt being held up at gunpoint in a dark alley by a stranger who has not had sex in a while. Our minds tend to overlook the other scenarios that still constitute as rape. <a href="http://www.rccmsc.org/resources/get-the-facts.aspx" target="_blank">Surveys</a> show that 60 percent of rape victims knew the person who attacked them. And in college, recreational drugs are often present in about 75 percent of college cases. You go out to a party with a friend whom you trust to take care of you and ends up taking advantage of you instead, and no one was wearing a short skirt.

To be explicitly clear, the federal law does not permit anyone who is under the influence of drugs to consent to sexual intercourse. This is not the kind of gray area in which you can make ridiculous statements like “But they really wanted to!” In fact, it is not a gray area at all. To those who would like to argue with me on this point and try to justify having sex with someone who has been drinking (or using any other kind of drug), I personally believe that you should be exiled to Antarctica in your bathing suit. But, since that does not happen because of our judicial system, the sexual exploitation of people under the influence should not happen either. A law for a law.

We all distance ourselves from the concept of rape. It is something that happens on “Law and Order,” not to people in my life. But if you really knew just how prevalent it is and just how many carry that burden in silence, you would be the one in silence. And yet, it is the victims who suffer alone and tell no one. You have all heard that one uber-feminist who argues against mascara and blowdryers as weapons of our male-dominated society also throw around the phrase “victim blaming.” You can never understand how deep-rooted this concept is until you have looked at yourself in the mirror after being raped and telling yourself “it was my fault.” I understand that a lot of this article is uncomfortable, but the more we discuss the issue and the more light we shed on it,the less these terrible things will exist in our society.

So I invite you all to join the discussion. If only we could all take advantage of Stony Brook’s cheap tuition instead of someone’s body.]]></content:encoded>

Mellor's proposal encompasses a total of five miles of terrain. <em>ARIEL RAHIMZADA / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

One Stony Brook University student’s senior project is growing into a cause that hundreds of students support. Hannah Mellor, an environmental design, policy and planning major, made a proposal to Stony Brook faculty and administration for a nature trail uniting the various pre-existing trails on campus.

Mellor envisioned the trail for her senior Sustainability Studies project in fall 2014. She has since attracted a team of dedicated students to assist her in accomplishing her goal.

Mellor saw the potential of several pre-existing trails sprawled throughout campus. She mapped out 2.5 miles of trail terrain, much of which are tough to navigate and explore. Mellor proposed connecting all the pre-existing trails, making a total of five miles of terrain.

Mellor presented a 34-page proposal to various academic department heads and faculty organizations like Vice President for Strategic Initiatives Matthew Whelan.

“I was impressed at her enthusiasm for the process,” Whelan said. “I was impressed by the work she had done. I am always impressed when students take action. I expressed through my professional responsibilities, some concerns about safety and security, cost of maintenance  and ADA [American Disabilities Act] access.”

Mellor was not discouraged.

“We brought it up to the school,” Mellor said, “and then we brought it up to the students and it keeps growing and growing.”

Students came pouring in with enthusiasm for the project. She collected 500 petition signatures in support of the trail in just one week and another 500 likes on the “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/sbunaturetrail">SBU Nature Trail</a>” Facebook page.

“I completely understand where the school is coming from, and I agree with them, but it’s still people want to see happen,” Mellor said.

Not only will this trail impact the students, but it will also be available to the community and residents of Stony Brook.

“It will be a fantastic addition to the passive recreation activities that we enjoy in Stony Brook,” Shawn Nuzzo, President of the Civic Association of the Setaukets and Stony Brook, said. “For years the university and local community have been struggling with the literal and figurative disconnect between the campus and its host community. Projects like this serve to link the campus and surrounding community and I look forward to walking the trail myself.”

According to Mellor, the trail will be a enjoyable outlet for joggers, dog walkers, and anyone who wants to use it.

“I love the idea,” Suffolk County Legislator Kara Hahn said, “you just have to make sure the community is on board, and that the proposed portion running up against homes is enough distance away [from residential homes].”

Last weekend Mellor and the team held an informal trail tour/construction. Mellor marked the trail on Saturday, and Sunday was the first day of actually clearing up the first mile. On Sunday they met at noon in the Mendelsohn parking lot and from there, they walked to the trailhead together with anyone who wished to join.

“I am trying to get the word out there,” Mellor said, “to get as many students as possible to support, as many faculty members and as many outside organizations.”

Mellor is awaiting administration approval to trail blaze more terrain this upcoming Sunday, time and location to be determined.

There is also an app available on <a href="http://sbunaturetrail.blogspot.com/">sbunaturetrail.blogspot.com</a> that maps out the trail and tells users where they are located on the trail to prevent people from getting lost.]]></content:encoded>

We at the Stony Brook University Graduate Queer Alliance (GQA) believe that a university should provide an open forum for controversial ideas to be discussed and debated. We encourage open dialogue as a way to evaluate evidence, formulate opinions and communicate those opinions to others. However, not all ideas are morally fungible. Some are, in fact, harmful, and at a liberal educational institution, injurious ideas are rightfully criticized and not given an unquestioned platform to be presented. A different mechanism of presentation is required if ideas are deemed potentially harmful, and this mechanism holds to a higher standard the rigor with which they will be subsequently evaluated.

The “<a href="https://youtu.be/hBrs-kAZluw" target="_blank">debate</a>” that happened at the Student Activities Center auditorium at Stony Brook University on April 16 flies in the face of the kind of dialogue encouraged at a public institution, especially dialogue funded with public money. The topic of the debate was, “What better explains morality, God or science?” At its surface, it seems like a complex and controversial topic (that myopically assumed only two answers), but is, nevertheless, one that students should engage. The problem with this debate was not the topic, but the people debating the topic.

Michael Shermer, who is an author and has a monthly "Skeptic" column in Scientific American, was arguing for science, and Frank Turek was arguing for God. The latter is a prominent conservative Christian with what might be considered <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.glaad.org%2Fcap%2Ffrank-turek&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHTwdolvHg03o8cSARBzI3mKMPSog" target="_blank">extreme</a> perspectives on certain issues, especially homosexuality. Given our current political climate and the background of Dr. Turek, it was inevitable that this topic would be engaged during the debate. Turek’s positions are clear and in the public sphere. Although the LGBTQ* spectrum includes more than just gay people, gay people were the explicit focus of the presenters at this debate. In fact, Dr. Turek has written a book deriding gays and suggesting doom for countries that accept them in any way, shape, or form (as how the book was advertised by the moderator).

During the debate, Dr. Turek informed the audience that he has met many former homosexuals but never a former African American. He incited a clear divide between African Americans and gays by claiming that one is a more legitimate minority than the other. He also stated that gays have a choice in their sexual orientation, implying that they could choose not to be gay and therefore avoid discrimination, unlike African Americans who cannot choose their skin color. He discussed how a “homosexual lifestyle” was deadly, and when pressed by Dr. Shermer to define said lifestyle, he refused out of respect to the audience, citing the implied vulgarity of the answer. This refusal came following his 20-minute debate introduction where he showed Nazi propaganda videos and discussed torturing and murdering children in Nazi death camps. His implication was that the “homosexual lifestyle” is in some way worse and more discourteous than these genocidal war crimes.

In addition to this nonsense, Turek was openly and unabashedly Islamophobic, sexist and misogynistic. He misrepresented the views of a variety of other groups as well, and mocked and denied the theory of evolution the same week that scientists at Stony Brook discovered humanity's oldest stone tools.

Turek’s propaganda is so far from the truth that it should be self-evident in the 21st century and especially to the millennial generation that currently attends Stony Brook that a speaker who holds these beliefs should not be given such a prestigious platform to speak in the first place. This is not an issue of free speech, not least because the views that Dr. Turek expresses have already been evaluated and exchanged in public forums countless times, and it has been concluded that they are indeed wrong and harmful. We do not tolerate people who advocate for ridiculous things like racial segregation in schools an unquestioned platform to speak, despite the fact that they are allowed to express those views in other public forums. A public school administration would rightfully fight the expression of bigotry like this on a college campus, so why should someone who speaks just as hatefully toward gays and other groups be treated differently?

We may live in a country and a world where many of people do in fact agree with Dr. Turek. However, this does not change the fact that what he is saying is factually incorrect and truly harmful to students. Again, disagreement and debate on social and moral matters, even when there is a common set of facts, is the crux of a liberal university culture. Free and open debate should be encouraged, but not when what is being said is so clearly wrong and so clearly harmful to others.

The nature of the university demands that there be a mechanism to discuss all views, as objectionable and repulsive as some of them might be. In fact, one might argue that exposing these views to the public might allow them to be subject to an enhanced degree of criticism, which would not happen if they were censored. This is why the GQA endorses the idea that more speech and dialogue about this sensitive matter, not less, is the solution when there are conflicting interests at play. The goal is a “positive sum game” where all viewpoints can be presented and evaluated in a manner consistent with our school’s values.

When Columbia University invited the Holocaust-denying former president of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to speak at the school, there was of course protest, and rightly so. However, the event was widely publicized and constructive criticism of the event happened both before, during and after. Indeed, the president of the Jewish organization Hillel signed a declaration of support for the event (and at the same time criticized the school for not giving students more notice for the event). As far as the LGBTQ* community at SBU is concerned, Turek’s views towards us are similar to Ahmadinejad’s towards Jewish people. Turek actively denies the existence of LGBTQ* people, and (at least it should) go without saying that this nonsense should not be tolerated. President Lee Bollinger of Columbia, in introducing former President Ahmadinejad, spoke out against his intolerance in Iran to his face. On the other hand, the event at Stony Brook was organized with support from the School of Social Welfare, which extolled Turek and New York Apologetics. The event was not advertised to students, even though it used public resources. No notification to the campus was given that this event was taking place and LGBTQ* services was not informed, despite the homophobic reputation of one of the speakers.

Stony Brook is a prestigious research school, with a rich history of activism and liberalism. It is incumbent upon the administration at all levels to ensure fair and open dialogue without bringing harm to any community on campus. In some cases, Turek’s homophobic comments were met with roaring applause, demonstrating the level of misunderstanding and lack of empathy for LGBTQ* and other minorities at Stony Brook. This becomes significant as we live in a benighted age when institutional homophobia and queerphobia hide behind supposed freedoms of expression and religion, guaranteed in the Constitution. Turek’s hate-speech instigates and nourishes a culture of homophobia and should simply not be tolerated on campus without the appropriate actions taken to put it into context.

At the Graduate Queer Alliance, we believe in free speech, we believe in the freedom to practice one’s faith, we believe in diversity. We support these things even if opinions are different from our own. However, we are vehemently against pointless bigotry of any sort. Together with other LGBTQ* groups and other clubs and organizations on campus, we are passing resolutions against Turek’s hate-speech. At our weekly meeting, we passed a resolution demanding censure of the School of Social Welfare’s decision to host this event in the dark, in a flawed manner, and with public funds. We will ask for an apology from the administrator(s) involved in bringing Dr. Turek and his homophobia to campus without following proper protocols that should be second nature when dedicating time and resources to an event at a university. We ask for the Offices of the President, the Dean of Students, the Graduate School and the University Senate to reiterate the university’s commitment to providing an inclusive environment for all students, especially LGBTQ* folks, to flourish and grow. More dialogue on this manner will not simply meet needs of LGBTQ* students, but will teach all students about how an academic culture of freedom should operate. We open our meetings to provide a safe space to members of the university community to heal from Dr. Turek’s bigotry and encourage further discussion on this matter.]]></content:encoded>

We at the Stony Brook University <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/stonybrookgqa/">Graduate Queer Alliance</a> (GQA) believe that a University should provide an open forum for controversial ideas to be discussed and debated. We encourage open dialogue as a way to evaluate evidence, formulate opinions, and communicate those opinions to others. However, not all ideas are morally fungible. Some are in fact harmful, and at a liberal educational institution, injurious ideas are rightfully criticized and not given an unquestioned platform to be presented. A different mechanism of presentation is required if ideas are deemed potentially harmful, and this mechanism holds to a higher standard the rigor with which they will be subsequently evaluated.

&nbsp;

The “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBrs-kAZluw&amp;feature=youtu.be">debate</a>” that happened at the Student Activities Center auditorium at Stony Brook University on April 16th flies in the face of the kind of dialogue encouraged at a public institution, especially dialogue funded with public money. The topic of the debate was, “What better explains morality, God or science?” At its surface, it seems like a complex and controversial topic (that myopically assumes only two answers), but is nevertheless one that students should engage. The problem with this debate was not the topic, but the people debating the topic.

&nbsp;

<a href="http://www.michaelshermer.com/">Michael Shermer</a>, who is an author and has a monthly <i>Skeptic</i> column in Scientific American, was arguing for science, and <a href="http://crossexamined.org/dr-frank-turek/">Frank Turek</a> was arguing for God.

This man can take more from a student than a parent. This man’s legend is so large, he commands a standing ovation not only for his arrival, but for every point he makes and every question he answers. This man is Neil deGrasse Tyson.

His lecture/student powwow at Stony Brook on April 27 will go down as one of the most inspirational and unconventional ways of motivating students. Using his rare tone that is both nurturing and involves best friend-like backlash, Tyson proved why he is considered the best astrophysics lecturer whoever lived.

The former People Magazine "Hottest Astrophysicist Alive" proved once again why he is so lovable by combining everyday experiences into a physics and astronomically power-punched experience that transcended science. For a while, you were in his world of physics even though you knew nothing about physics. Even for those not math or science oriented, you could not help but feel like Isaac Newton himself was explaining why physics makes sense.

It was not just the science that grabbed you, it was the man and the personality. It is well documented that Tyson commands a presence, but the magnitude of it is not understandable until he is standing there in front of you. You just want to hug him. That presence drives his message which is knowledge of everything around you. He is a well-mannered man full of surprises. He was a dancer, a wrestler and, above all else, a self motivated child of science. His childhood only advances his thoughts in adulthood and that wisdom driven from years of experience makes the man's legend only grow.

With all the love this man commands, the truly impressive aspect of his demeanor is his ability to swing an audience with comedy. It is rare that an astrophysicist/dancer/wrestler/public speaker/amazing human being can combine so many traits but without that comedic timing and personality, Tyson would be left dreary and he acknowledges that before everyone else. The timing of every punch line, the speech of every joke and the body movements of every major point truly drove his message into the students hearts and certainly my own.

Public speakers are often broken down into three major categories: message, speech and personality. Most speakers get a pass for one of these three things as personality is often portrayed through contrived personalities developed specifically for the stage (as in Stephen Colbert’s character on the "Colbert Report"), but you get the feeling that Tyson is his own man all the time.

The skeptic in me wants to believe that this man cannot be real. Tyson is, in fact, just a man. The man’s message to everyone says just that and he tries to tell you to be your own person and not the person that anyone forces you to be. Who knows for sure, maybe Tyson is not the character he portrays at his speeches and on his shows. Maybe Tyson can be mean sometimes and is not always that father we all want. But for now, Tyson has inspired me to write this love piece in his honor. He has inspired me to write this and he will inspire many to pursue their dream and that is all a profound public speaker should do.

On behalf of the entire student, public and faculty body that attended your speech, you are a man of many talents, but we will remember you as a man who loves the word "niblets."

Thank you, Dr. Tyson, for your continued contribution to the motivation and advancement of academia.

The Seawolves defeated Vermont 16-13 to advance to the championship game.<em> MANJU SHIVACHARAN / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

After scoring a career-high 11 points in their last meeting, senior Mike Rooney came up big for the Seawolves once more and scored nine points in Stony Brook's America East Semifinal win against the Vermont Catamounts, 16-13.

The Seawolves went on a tear in the third quarter, outscoring the Catamounts 5-1. Defensively, Stony Brook locked down Albany’s Bob Ford Field causing two turnovers and not allowing the Catamounts to score for a five-minute stretch.  Stony Brook's fluid offense was led by sophomore midfielder Alex Corpolongo, who had two goals in the period.

To contrast, the Seawolves' first quarter was plagued by a pestering Catamount defense, as Vermont caused four turnovers. In the first nine minutes, Vermont only allowed one Stony Brook goal.

The slow start made it look like that Vermont was going to beat Stony Brook for the first time in program history.

Rooney, trying to keep the Seawolves afloat, kept sprinting to the Catamounts' cage in the first 15 minutes and fired off four shots, resulting in one goal to get the Catamount's lead down to one at 3-2.

Junior Brody Eastwood scored an equalizer, tying the game at 3 until Vermont sophomore Ian MacKay, the Catamounts leader in goals, got passed sophomore goalkeeper Hayden Johnstone and put the Catamounts up one to end the quarter.

Even though the Catamounts could not keep up their aggressive defense for the second and third quarters, they re-energized for the fourth. They turned the Seawolves over and scored two goals off of them. However, their defense could not stop Rooney from scoring two goals of his own.

Stony Brook played a game of attrition towards the end. Several of its possessions in the last ten minutes of the fourth quarter lasted at least one minute. The Seawolves waited until the referees nearly called a delay of game on several occasions.

While Rooney was the story of the afternoon, junior Challen Rogers was the story of the second quarter. Rogers scored a hat trick off of three bullets and put the Seawolves up 6-5 with 8:44 left in the half. The hat trick is his third of the season and his second against Vermont this season.

The win against Vermont means a return to the America East Championship game for Stony Brook Head Coach Jim Nagle after a two year hiatus.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_40058" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="size-full-width wp-image-40058" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/04302015_TakeBackTheNight_Simon.Sharp_90-600x399.jpg" alt="SIMON SHARP / THE STATESMAN" width="600" height="399" /> On April 29, the Center for Womyn's Concerns held its annual "Take Back the Night" march. The event was organized to raise awareness of sexual assault and abuse on campus.

“I am Sarah Elizabeth Tubbs, and I am a survivor of sexual assault committed on Stony Brook University’s campus,” said the Stony Brook University alumna, who is suing the school for alleged mistreatment of her sexual assault case, in a speech at the “Take Back the Night event on Wednesday, April 29.

The Center for Womyn’s Concerns organizes the annual “Take Back The Night” event to raise awareness of sexual assault and abuse on campus.

Tubbs accused a male student of sexually assaulting her in his dorm room after a party at West Apartments last January, and she filed a lawsuit against the university for their “deliberate indifference” in the case. Tubbs, who graduated last year, is now a social work student working towards her masters at Hunter College.

The march started in the Student Activities Center and progressed down the Zebra Path toward the Island Federal Credit Union Arena. From there, the students went to West Apartments and through the footpath to Tabler Quad. Halfway through the woods, the executive board held a moment of silence for victims of sexual assault and read stories aloud that were submitted via a Tumblr page.

Curious heads popped out of windows in Sanger and Toscanini Colleges looking to see who was walking out of the woods in Tabler Quad and chanting, “Seawolves unite! Take back the night!”

“I’m excited to get the attention of everyone who is not in here and not in the march. You don’t have to be in it necessarily to get impacted by it,” Karol Perez, vice president of the Center for Womyn’s Concerns, said.

The executive board of the Center for Womyn’s Concerns has been working all semester to put on the event. The event was also run in part by the Center for Prevention and Outreach and the sisters of Sigma Psi Zeta.

“It’s far reaching because with the 135 or more [people] that we have here it’s going to reach an innumerable amount,” President of the Center for Womyn’s Concerns Katelyn Morrie said. “We want the survivors, that even if we don’t know who they are, to know that there is always support through the university and through the CWC.”

Before the march began, Dean of Students Timothy Ecklund and Deputy Title IX Coordinator Cathrine Duffy spoke to introduce Tubbs.

The executive board of the Center for Womyn’s Concerns said Tubbs was quick to accept the invitation to speak at the event but Tubbs said it gives her discomfort to be back on the campus at the university that gave her trouble.

“It’s always scary coming back on campus,” Tubbs said. “It’s never easy, but I’m glad that I’m able to aid in change and hopefully empower more survivors.”

Tubbs said she was nervous to speak before the event began. She repeatedly looked to her friends and family for reassurance. Her supporters rubbed her back and gave her hugs.

In her speech, Tubbs spoke in the third person about a girl she knew who was raped and could not function properly after the incident. She went on to reveal that the girl is herself.

“I have been battling PTSD for over a year with frequent flashbacks, disassociations, panic attacks, anxiety—all things I don’t want to remember,” Tubbs said.

After the speech by Tubbs, the allies and supporters relocated to Student Activities Center Ballroom A to make posters and t-shirts for the march. The marchers used electric tea lights to light up the night.

Following the march participants had the opportunity to go to three different informational sessions: “Men Against Violence,” “Active Ally Event” and “Survivor’s and Supporters Speakout.”

In her message to herself shared in her speech, Tubbs said: “You can fly and you can soar. Soar beyond the cloud you saw before. Soar beyond your wildest imagination, because you know what, Sarah? It’s time to start living the life you’ve always imagined.”]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_40161" align="alignleft" width="600"]<img class="size-full-width wp-image-40161" src="http://sbstatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/MG_0258-600x400.jpg" alt="CHRISTOPHER CAMERON / THE STATESMAN" width="600" height="400" /> The Stony Brook Seawolves, above, will advance to the America East Championship for the fourth-straight season following a 16-5 victory over UMBC on Friday, May 1. <em>CHRISTOPHER CAMERON / THE STATESMAN</em>[/caption]

After a surprisingly competitive first half, the No. 5 Stony Brook women’s lacrosse team demonstrated its prowess and pulled away from the visiting UMBC Retrievers, winning 16-5 on a Friday evening conference semifinal game at Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium.

Courtney Murphy scored seven goals, Dorrien Van Dyke scored three more and the Seawolves will advance to the America East championship game on Sunday afternoon. Stony Brook is looking to win its third-consecutive conference championship and NCAA tournament bid.

Murphy’s seven goals set an America East conference tournament record. The sophomore attacker has 67 goals on the season, six of which came in the second half of the contest.

Taylor Ranftle had a strong first half, distributing the ball for the Seawolves offense. The junior attacker assisted on the first three Stony Brook goals of the game, the third of which found the stick of Amber Kupres, who gave the Seawolves an early 3-2 advantage. Kupres had three assists and a game-high five draw controls in the match.

A goal by UMBC freshman Carolyn Jamison made the score 3-3 with 6:14 remaining in the first half. After Seawolves captain Michelle Rubino won the ensuing faceoff, Van Dyke ran the ball in from centerfield and struck twice for her second goal of the game to quickly return the lead to Stony Brook, giving the Seawolves a 4-3 lead at halftime.

For a team projected to be a top-5 seed in the upcoming NCAA tournament, the one-goal lead at the half was underwhelming. Stony Brook trailed 5-2 in draw controls at the half and committed 13 fouls as frustration mounted. At one point, the team was forced to kill a three-player UMBC power-play due to a trio of yellow cards in a 27 second span.

“I was very angry. Not disappointed, I was angry.” Head Coach Joe Spallina said of the tight first half. “We came out flat and that’s unacceptable this time of year. I thought that first half was one of the worst first halves we played all season.”

“I think we all tend to look to each other when things get hectic,” Rubino said. “We tried to keep our composure and keep our heads in the game.”

Persistence paid off. In the second half, the Stony Brook offense began to take control of the game. The Seawolves went on a run and blew out their conference counterparts, outscoring them 12-2 after the break. After a scoreless first half, Seawolves freshman and Tewaaraton Award nominee Kylie Ohlmiller tallied six second-half points on two goals and four assists.

“Offensively, we started to click more [after halftime],” Murphy said. “In the first half offensively, we’re away from coach and were on the opposite side of the field. It’s definitely a disadvantage for us when we don’t have him chirping in our ears, telling us what to do.”

Murphy opened the after-break scoring with her second of the game, assisted by America East Rookie of the Year Ohlmiller. The advantage was made 6-3 four minutes later, when Rubino took the ball, danced around a couple defenders and potted a goal with 21:40 remaining in the game.

Murphy and sophomore Kristin Yevoli scored two more within the next minute to extend the Seawolves’ lead to 8-3 and put the game effectively out of reach.

Rubino and Ohlmiller wowed the crowd with pair of individual efforts late in the second half, the latter of whom netted a goal behind her back, and the Seawolves were comfortably on their way to another conference championship game.

Defensively, Stony Brook was stellar once again. The nation’s second-ranked defense forced 16 turnovers and went 13-for-14 on clear attempts. Kupres and Alyssa Fleming each had three ground balls for the Seawolves.

The America East conference tournament game will be on Sunday at 12 p.m. on the home turf of LaValle Stadium against the winner of the Albany vs. Vermont matchup late Friday night.

“We’re one win away from getting the [automatic qualifier,]" Spallina said. "Our RPI is very high, and we’re a win away from being one of the top five seeds in the tournament."]]></content:encoded>
